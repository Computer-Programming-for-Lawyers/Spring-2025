# Welcome to Computer Programming for Lawyers!
This is where you'll be able to find code and materials that we use during lecture and labs. You can find the [course syllabus on Canvas](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/195784/assignments/syllabus).

**If you are struggling with getting Codespaces set up, please read [getting-started-codespaces.md](getting-started-codespaces.md).**

<!-- ## Instructions for Working with this Repository During Lectures and Labs

In this guide, you will learn how to create a forked repository (essentially, your own private version) from the original course repository in GitHub Codespaces and how to pull changes from the master repository into your forked repository. This helps ensure that your work stays up-to-date with the latest changes made by the instructors.

### Part 1: Creating a Forked Repository from the Original Repository via Codespaces

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Codespace from the Original Repository

1. Navigate to the [original course repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Computer-Programming-for-Lawyers/Fall-2024).
2. Click the "Code" button, then select "Codespaces" from the dropdown menu.
3. Click "Create codespace on main" (or whatever the default branch is named).
4. GitHub will set up a new Codespace environment for you based on the original course repository.

#### Step 2: Attempt to Commit a Change and Follow Terminal Instructions to Fork

1. Make a small change to any file in the Codespace. For example, you can add a comment or modify a line of code.
2. In the terminal, stage the changes by running:
    `git add .`
3. Next, attempt to commit the changes:
    `git commit -m "commit for fork"`
4. The terminal will ask if you want to proceed with creating a fork. Enter `Y`. This process will automatically point your Codespace to your new fork.

### Part 2: Pulling Changes from the Master Repository into Your Forked Repository

In order to keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository, you have to "pull" changes occassionally. To do that, take the following steps:

* In the terminal, run:

    `git fetch upstream`
    
    This command retrieves the latest changes from the master repository but does not apply them to your branch yet.

* Next, run:

    `git checkout main`

* Finally, merge the changes from the original repository:

    `git merge upstream/main`

* To save your work after class or during a critical juncture, merge the changes back to your fork on GitHub:

    `git add . `
    
    `git commit -m "<your commit message>"`
    
    `git push`

> [!TIP]
> You have to do this regularly in order to stay up to date with changes. In some cases, you may have to resolve conflicting files. Follow on screen instructions and consult online resources (like Stack Overflow) when that happens. If you can't figure it out, reach out for help on Ed. -->
