    "# 2. Generate every single date from 01/01/00 to 12/31/99 <------ this is the meat of the exercise.\n",
    "# 3. Hash the date from (2) and compare it with the hashed value input by the user (1)\n",
    "## +@ there will be some control flows to follow after step 3, depending on the outcome which is:\n",
    "## a) if there is a match, print matching date and immediately exit the program.\n",
