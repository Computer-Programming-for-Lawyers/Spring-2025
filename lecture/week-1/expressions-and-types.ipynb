    "\n",
    "An integer and a floating-point number are both types of numerical data in Python, but they represent numbers in different ways and are used for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer (`int`):\n",
    "- **Definition:** An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero, and it has no fractional or decimal component.\n",
    "- **Examples:** `-3`, `0`, `7`, `42`\n",
    "- **Usage:** Integers are used when you need to represent whole numbers, such as counting items, indexing elements in a list, or performing operations where fractions or decimals aren't needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating-Point Number (`float`):\n",
    "- **Definition:** A floating-point number is a number that can represent both whole numbers and numbers with a fractional part, i.e., numbers that include a decimal point.\n",
    "- **Examples:** `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0`, `42.5`\n",
    "- **Usage:** Floats are used when you need to represent numbers that are not whole, such as measurements, averages, or any calculations involving fractions or decimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "1. **Precision:**\n",
    "   - **Integers:** Represent exact whole numbers.\n",
    "   - **Floats:** Can represent numbers with a fractional component, but because of how computers store these numbers, they may not always be exact. This can lead to small rounding errors, especially in complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Usage:**\n",
    "   - **Integers:** Typically use less memory because they store whole numbers without any fractional part.\n",
    "   - **Floats:** Use more memory because they store both the whole part and the fractional part of a number, and they include additional information about the position of the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operations:**\n",
    "   - **Integers:** When performing arithmetic operations with integers, the result is usually also an integer (except when division is involved, which can result in a float).\n",
    "   - **Floats:** Operations involving floats will typically result in a float, even if both operands are integers."
