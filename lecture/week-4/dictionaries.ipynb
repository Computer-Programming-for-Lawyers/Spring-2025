    "# Week 4 Lecture Notebook: Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "We've spent the better part of two lectures talking about lists. Lists are a way of storing collections of values. But they're only one way of doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists impose some very specific constraints on how we store data.\n",
    "  * Lists keep track of data based on the order in which they are stored. All of the operations we know for modifying lists are all about order: indices to access list elements by positions, append to add items to the end of the list, insert to add items in other positions. Order is everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Python provides us with another way to store data. This is the data structure we'll discuss for a little while now and a lot more time next week.\n",
    "  * This alternative is known as a *dictionary*\n",
    "  * A dictionary is actually a great name for what it does.\n",
    "    * In ordinary English, a dictionary matches each word to a definition. If you want to know what a word means, you look it up in the dictionary and you find the corresponding definition.\n",
    "    * And with an English dictionary, you canâ€™t find a word by a definition. The dictionary is **indexed** by words, not the other way around.\n",
    "    * In python, we would call the words *keys*, and the definitions *values*.\n",
    "    * Importantly, each key can only have one value. You can't have a word with multiple definitions in a Python dictionary.\n",
    "    * Dictionaries are not ordered. It doesn't matter what order the keys and values were stored in."
