Plaintiffs brought challenges to Wisconsin's election procedures, requesting that the court change them in light of COVID-19. Plaintiff DNC had previously requested an extension to the mail-in ballot deadline before the Wisconsin primary elections, which the Supreme Court approved, althought it added a requirement that ballots be postmarked by election day. On remand, the District Court issued an injunction again extending the mail-in ballot deadline for the November election, requiring the state to permit polls to employ workers from different counties, and granting some voters a window by which they could submit votes electronically if they had not yet received their mail-in ballot. Defendants appealed this injunction, and the Seventh Circuit stayed it, explaining that the injunction had been issued too close to the election, in violation of the Supreme Court's precedent in Purcell v. Gonzales. Plaintiffs then filed an emergency application to vacate the Seventh Circuit's stay, arguing that the Seventh Circuit panel misapplied Supreme Court precedent.",Active,https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=312

They filed a complaint alleging that this deadline violates two provisions of the Delaware Constitution: one guaranteeing the right to vote, and another guaranteeing ""free and equal"" elections. Plaintiffs allege that, because so many more voters will be casting votes by mail this election, the deadline will cause a larger than usual number of ballots to be rejected. Additionally, plaintiffs allege that recent slowdowns in USPS shipping mean that voters, through no fault of their own, may submit ballots that do not arrive until after Election Day.

Under the Postal Reorganization Act, USPS is required to meet certain mail delivery standards and is further required to seek an advisory opinion requiring a hearing and opportunity for comment from the Postal Regulatory Commission prior to instituting any changes which impact national service. The changes specifically challenged include 1) prohibiting late or extra trips by postal workers 2) requiring carriers to adhere to rigid start and stop times 3) limiting the use of overtime 4) no longer treating election mail as first class mail automatically and 5) no longer delivering first class mail regardless of whether or not it has sufficient postage. The States allege harms to their sovereign, quasi-sovereign and proprietary interests in administering elections, not having to devote significant additional resources to administering elections and conducting government functions including the operation of the state civil and criminal judicial systems. The States assert four causes of action. 1) violation of the Postal Reorganization Act by failing to follow the procedural requirements before instituting changes 2) violation of the Postal Reorganization Act by failing to satisfy the mail standards for delivery under the act due to changes 3) violations of the States' rights under the elections and elector clauses by undermining the States' ability to regulate elections under both clauses and 4) a violation of the 26th amendment caused by the fact that changes to USPS delivery standards resulting in a diminished ability to vote by mail will most impact older voters who are most likely to vote by mail.",Closed,https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=203

Ct.)",Idaho,07/16/2020,"Plaintiffs, Texas voters with disabilities and organizations that represent those individuals, bring claims under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 against the Texas Secretary of State for failing to provide them means of voting secretly and independently and otherwise denying them equal access to mail in ballots, preventing them from voting safely due to COVID-19. They seek preliminary and injunctive relief preventing Defendant from violating these statutory provisions and requiring a remote accessible vote by mail system as well as declaratory relief. Plaintiffs challenge the fact that vote by mail ballots must be filled out and returned by voters entirely on paper which prevents the blind and other voters from using them without help, thus violating the right to cast a private vote. Instead plaintiffs claim that defendant should allow county election officials to provide accessible electronic ballots for these individuals as already provided to overseas voters. These difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that blind individuals are unable to determine on their own whether others at polling places are complying with safety measures like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.",Closed,https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=232

Otherwise, the suit alleges, plaintiff have multiple federal law claims: (1) violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because voters are denied the right to vote on account of race and language minority and denied an equal opportunity to participate in the political process, (2) race discrimination under the 14th Amendment, (3) race discrimination under the 15th Amendment, (4) non-racial discrimination in voting under the 14th Amendment, (5) denial of free speech under the 1st and 14th Amendments, (6) violation of procedural due process for vagueness under 14th amendment, (7) abridgment of the right to vote based on age under the 26th Amendment, and (7) voter intimidation and conspiracy to interfere with civil rights under Section 1985 of Civil Rights Act of 1871. Some of the plaintiffs had filed a state court lawsuit on March 20, but decided to file this federal case in light of the Supreme Court's decision on the Wisconsin primary on April 6, 2020 that it was too late to remedy constitutional harms. Thus, the plaintiffs here decided to act as early as possible to get timely merits review. 
On May 19, 2020 the District Court ruled that the ""disability"" provision in the state's vote-by-mail election code applies to all registered voters who ""lack immunity from COVID-19 and fear infection at polling places."" The ruling is in effect until the case goes to trial or the pandemic subsides.",Closed,https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=131

 Claims: (1) Expiration of Secretary of State’s emergency waiver of ‘no-excuse’ absentee voting is violation of the fundamental right to vote under Article I section 33 and Article VIII section 177 of the Alabama Constitution; (2) failure to exercise emergency authority to waive photo ID requirement for absentee ballot application is violation of same sections of Alabama Constitution; (3) failure to exercise emergency authority to waive requirement of notary or 2 witness for submission of completed absentee ballot is a violation of same sections of Alabama Constitution; (4) failure to modify deadlines for absentee ballot (application and submission) is a violation of Alabama Constitution; (5) failure to exercise emergency authority to adopt safety procedures for in person voting, including early voting to promote social distancing, is a violation of same sections of Alabama Constitution. 
 The suit requests that the court declare the defendants failures violates the plaintiffs’ right to vote as guaranteed by Alabama Constitution, enjoin defendants from failing to modify absentee ballot requirements and failing to adopt safety measures for in person voting, and enter a preliminary injunction ordering defendants (Secretary of State Merrill and Governor Ivey) to promptly submit an emergency plan remedying these constitutional violations and notifying all Alabama voters of emergency measures.",Closed,https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=38

App.)",New York,05/14/2020,"The ACLU and ACLU of Missouri filed this lawsuit seeking to make absentee mail-in balloting available to all eligible voters in Missouri. The case was filed on behalf of the NAACP of Missouri, the League of Women Voters of Missouri, and several individuals. Missouri requires an excuse in order to vote absentee. One of the permitted excuses is “incapacity or confinement due to illness or physical disability,” §115.277.1(2), RSMo, and voting pursuant to this excuse does not require notarization.
 Legal Claims: The lawsuit charges that refusing to allow no-excuse absentee voting — or in the alternative, refusing to allow voters who are confining themselves to avoid contracting or spreading COVID-19 to vote absentee without notarization under to §115.277.1(2), RSMo— is a violation of the right to vote under the Missouri Constitution and the state’s voting laws. Missouri had three upcoming elections (June, August, and November). The parties are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to clarify “that all eligible voters who wish to confine themselves to vote absentee to avoid contracting or spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 are eligible to vote absentee pursuant to §115.277.1(2), RSMo — without a notary seal.” The Circuit Court originally granted Defendant's motion to dismiss. The Missouri Supreme Court subsequently reversed in part after which the Circuit Court denied a preliminary injunction.

"Gusciora v. McGreevey, No. MER-L-2691-04 (N.J. Sup. Ct., Mercer Cnty.)",New Jersey,05/11/2020,"Plaintiffs submitted a letter brief to enforce a final order issued over ten years ago, which banned online voting permanently in New Jersey because online votes can be hacked.
 
 The State confirmed through the media and a phone call that the May 12th election will have an online voting system for disabled voters to use. This violates the abovementioned order as well as Governor's Murphy Executive Order 105, which specified that all voting during the COVID-19 crisis will be done by mail.
 
 Plaintiffs claim: (1) The court has the inherent power to enforce its own judgment and should order State authorities to comply with the 2010 final order, which bans the State from conducting elections via the internet; and (2) since online votes can be altered and the State would be unable to confirm these votes' integrity, the votes of disabled individuals would not have equal weight or equal protection, therefore violating the New Jersey Constitution, which protects against ""the unequal treatment of those who should be treated alike.""
 
 Plaintiffs seek emergency injunctive relief to enjoin State authorities from implementing a vote by Internet-based program. Plaintiffs claim they are entitled to this relief because the final order was clear and unambiguous, voters will be irreparably harmed by an insecure online voting system, the State will not suffer harm from an injunction since vote-by-mail exists, and a strong public interest exists in preserving the integrity of elections and ensuring public confidence in the election process.
 
 The Court held a case management conference on May 18, after the election in question. There, Defendants stated that they do not intend to use an internet-based voting system in future elections. The Court then ordered the parties to cooperate and reach a written memorandum or agreement addressing the use of internet-based voting systems for future elections.",Closed,https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=80

Elec. Code § 86.002 (""Postage Tax""); (ii) the misleading postmark and receipt deadlines for mail voting ballots, id. § 86.007 (""Ballot Receipt Deadline""); (iii) the requirement to submit two “matching” handwriting samples to qualify for mail voting, id. § 87.027 (""Signature Match Requirement""); and (iv) the criminalization of a person assisting a voter in returning a marked mail voting ballot, id. § 86.006 (""Voter Assistance Ban"").

The challenged provisions include: strict limits on eligibility for absentee voting which do not recognize the pandemic as a valid excuse (""Eligibility Criteria""); criminal prohibitions on assisting voters to obtain absentee ballot requests (""Assistance Prohibitions""); and lack of opportunity to cure ballot rejections based on signature mismatch (""Signature Verification Provisions""). Failure to make mail voting available to all voters is alleged to impose an undue burden on the right to vote since it requires voters to risk the health and safety of themselves and their loved ones in order to vote.
 Legal Claims: The Eligibility Criteria violate the right to vote under the 1st and 14th Amendments (Anderson-Burdick). The Assistance Prohibitions violate the rights of free speech and association under the 1st and 14th Amendments. The Signature Verification Provisions violate the right to procedural due process under the 14th Amendment and the right to vote under the 1st and 14th Amendments.
 Complaint Amendment: The Complaint was amended on June 12, 2020 to add a challenged provision: the requirement that voters who register to vote by mail must vote in person in their first election after registering (""First-Time Voter Restriction""). The First-Time Voter Restriction is claimed to violate the right to vote under the 1st and 14th Amendments.",Closed,https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=21

Stat. § 6.87). Wisconsin’s by-mail and electronic registration deadlines, which require the registration to “be delivered to the office of the municipal clerk or postmarked no later than the 3rd Wednesday preceding the election” Wisconsin’s requirements that voters provide a copy of their proof of residence to register “burden voters during the current crisis. (Wis. Stat. § 6.34). Wisconsin’s requirement that they must provide a copy or scan of their voter ID when applying for an absentee ballot. (Wis. Stat. § 6.86). Wisconsin’s requirement that a voter must have a witness certify the truth of the information the voter provides on the ballot, id. § 6.87(2).

"City of Green Bay v. Bostelmann, No. 1:20-cv-00479 (E.D. Wis.)",Wisconsin,03/23/2020,"Washington state senator Lena Taylor, Tory Lowe (candidate for alderman in the City of Wilwaukee's 6th aldermanic district) and Justice Wisconsin Inc. (non-profit founded by Lowe) sued the Wilwaukee Election Commission and its members, seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to (1) postpone the April 2020 primary election, (2) permit early voting to continue, (3) extend the deadline for registering to vote electronically or by mail, and (4) ""cancel"" in-person reigstration and in-person voting. Complaint alleged defendants violated plaintiffs' civil rights under 42 U.S.C. 1983 (under First, Fourteenth, Sixteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments), 28 U.S.C. 2201 and 2202, and defendants abridged plaintiffs' voting rights in violation of 52 U.S.C. 10301. The Court denied plaintiffs' request for relief, stating that a federal court ordering the delay of a state-wide election raises federalism concerns which outweighed the requested relief. The Court also cited to the Supreme Court's decision in Republican Nat'l Committee v. Democratic Nat'l Committee (140 S.Ct. 1205) which held that the district court erred in ordering that absentee ballots mailed and postmarked after the April 7, 2020 election date be counted if received by April 13, 2020.",Closed,https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/detail?id=145

"Ohio ex rel. Ohio Democratic Party v. LaRose, No. 2020-0388 (Ohio S. Ct.)",Ohio,03/17/2020,"Plaintiffs originally filed this suit against the state of Wisconsin prior to the April 2020 primary election to enjoin the enforcement of several Wisconsin voting laws. They alleged under the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the coronovirus pandemic would otherwise pose an undue burden on their right to vote, and under the Fourteenth Amendment that the pandemic would result in a denial of procedural due process, since Wisconsin procedure for registering to vote and for absentee voting must comport with due process. Finally, they alleged a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since some Wisconsin cities and counties had taken measures in response to the pandemic to facilitate voting and others had not. In their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs sought to extend the March 18, 2020 deadline for by mail voter registration to April 3, suspend the requirements that copies of documents and photo IDs be included with voter registration and absentee ballot applications, enjoin the Election Day Receipt Deadline, while allowing all ballots postmarked on or before election day but received within a minimum of 10 days thereafter to be counted, and enjoin the requirement that voters submitting absentee ballots have a witness certify to the accuracy of the voter’s information on the ballot.  Legal Claims: Federal constitutional claims: The provisions unduly burden the federal constitutional right to vote (1st and 14th Amendments). Enforcement of the rules during the pandemic deprives plaintiffs of procedural due process (14th Amendment).
