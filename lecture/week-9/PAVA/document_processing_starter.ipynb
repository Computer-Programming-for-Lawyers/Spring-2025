    "# In-Class Activity: Evaluating the PAVA Program\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides starter code for analyzing narratives submitted by states and territories as part of the [Protection and Advocacy for Voting Access (PAVA)](https://www.acl.gov/programs/aging-and-disability-networks/state-protection-advocacy-systems) program. These narrative reports were obtained by the Bipartisan Policy Center via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The PAVA program was established by the [Help America Vote Act (HAVA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3295) of 2002, which authorized a new grant program to improve the accessibility of election systems for individuals with disabilities. **Section 291** supports nonprofit protection and advocacy systems that train, assist, and advocate for voters with disabilities, and evaluate the accessibility of voting systems and technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although recipients of these grants are required to submit annual reports on their activities, no comprehensive analysis has been done to evaluate their impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to evaluate the real-world impact of PAVA using state-reported activities from fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2023."
