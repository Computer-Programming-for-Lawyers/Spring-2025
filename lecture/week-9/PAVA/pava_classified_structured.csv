AR,2021,"An individual with a physical disability who utilized accessible parking spaces requested assistance from DRA with architectural accessibility issues at a county courthouse where she voted. A PAVA advocate discussed the particular issues with the client, then called several county and local officials to have the accessible aisle of a van parking space at the county courthouse re-striped. DRA staff confirmed that the parking space at issue was re-striped to meet ADA guidelines.",,,,,
AR,2023,"DRA did not work any cases funded with PAVA in FY2023; however, DRA did work a case about an individual not having the right to vote due to having a guardian. We were able to successfully resolve this issue for our client; however, because it involved filing with the court to obtain a resolution (legal action), we worked it under another grant.
DRA also worked three guardianship cases; because we obtained favorable results for our clients, their right to vote was retained or restored.  These cases were not funded by PAVA because the primary problem area was guardianship, and the right to vote was a successful by-product of the successful resolution to the guardianship issue.",,,,,
AZ,2020,"The Arizona Center for Disability Law’s (ACDL) Protection and Advocacy for Voter Access (PAVA) Program works to ensure that Arizonans with disabilities have an opportunity to cast a private and independent vote, and have full access to the electoral process in registering to vote, casting a vote, and accessing polling places. 

ACDL has developed collaborative, educational, and enforcement strategies to achieve our goal of ensuring full access to the electoral process. During Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20), ACDL’s PAVA activities focused on the following:

1. Increasing voter education opportunities for Arizonans with disabilities.

2. Increasing voter registration and voting participation by Arizonans with disabilities.

3. Collaborating and building partnerships with disability self-advocates, stakeholders, and disability organizations to improve statewide access to the electoral process for Arizonans with disabilities.

4. Protecting the rights of Arizonans with disabilities to cast a private and independent vote. 

5. Working with election officials at the state, county, and local level to ensure access to the electoral process, including the development and implementation of best practices to meet the needs of Arizonans with disabilities. 


ACDL’s FY20 Work to Increase Voter Education Opportunities for Arizonans with Disabilities 

In ACDL’s efforts to provide statewide voting rights trainings to Arizonans with disabilities, we worked in collaboration with several disability organizations to conduct a number of in-person and virtual trainings on voting rights in FY20. The trainings and curriculums were designed and implemented to meet the needs of various disability stakeholder groups, including persons with intellectual/developmental disabilities. Some of the organizations ACDL partnered with to provide voter rights trainings included the Arizona Statewide Independent Living Council (SILC) and the Youth Leadership Forum. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trainings were primarily conducted through a virtual platform, with American Sign Language and  Closed Captioning provided. 

In addition to providing voter training, ACDL also partnered with disability self-advocates and a variety of disability organizations to produce a series of three voter education videos in FY20. The videos provided information regarding the following voting topics: ways to vote in Arizona, why voting is important, and a demonstration of Maricopa's new accessible voting equipment. The following organizations provided their talents and support for this voter education video project: Youth Action Council of Arizona, Southwest Institute for Families and Children, Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered (SABE), People First of Arizona, Southern Arizona Association for the Visually Impaired, and the Maricopa County Recorder’s Office and Elections Department. The voter education videos were made publicly available on ACDL’s and its partners’ websites. Information concerning the videos and where to access them was distributed to a variety of stakeholders to amplify the impact of the voter education videos.  

In FY20, ACDL also began planning improvements for the PAVA portion of its website, including better organization and additional self-advocacy materials and resources to assist Arizonans with disabilities to understand and enforce their voting rights. ACDL will continue this work in FY21. 


ACDL’s FY20 Work to Increase Voter Registration and Voting Participation by Arizonans with Disabilities 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March 2020 all in-person voter registration endeavors reduced or ceased throughout the United States. This had a significant impact on ACDL’s ability to reach out and provide voter registration opportunities for Arizonans with disabilities. In an effort to address this barrier, ACDL applied to participate in the Arizona Secretary of State Online Voter Registration Unique URL Pilot Program, which was designed to encourage organizations conducting large-scale voter registration drives to do so electronically and securely through the Service Arizona website, rather than relying on paper forms. ACDL was approved to participate in the Unique URL Pilot Program and received an assigned unique URL to use/distribute for voter registration purposes. ACDL also received periodic reports of valid voter registrations and updates submitted through its assigned URL. 

ACDL partnered with twenty disability organizations to conduct and coordinate statewide virtual online voter registration activities for Arizonans with disabilities, including activities to encourage registration around National Disability Voter Registration Week (July 13-17, 2020) and National Voter Registration Day (September 22, 2020). Although ACDL faced challenges and barriers in its efforts to conduct virtual voter registration, many lessons were learned that will assist in preparations for voter registration efforts in future elections.



ACDL’s FY20 Work Collaborating and Building Partnerships with Disability Self-Advocates, Stakeholders, and Disability Organizations to Improve Statewide Access to the Electoral Process for Arizonans with Disabilities 

As part of ACDL’s efforts to build strong statewide partnerships around voting, we collaborated with disability self-advocates and several disability organizations in Arizona to develop strategies and implement projects to improve access to the electoral process for all Arizonans with disabilities. These activities included: in-person and virtual voting rights trainings, disability roundtable discussions, production of voter education videos, and a virtual voter registration drive and voter registration activities as part of National Voter Registration Day and National Disability Voter Registration Week. ACDL also participated in election town halls, statewide conferences, and virtual planning meetings as part of its collaboration and partnership-building efforts in FY20.   

ACDL collaborated with the following organizations and offices on voting activities in FY20: The Arc of Arizona, Arizona Citizens Clean Election Commission, Southwest Institute for Families and Children, Self Advocates Becoming Empowered (SABE), Brain Injury Alliance of Arizona, the Arizona Division of Developmental Disabilities, People First of Arizona, the Maricopa County Recorder’s Office and Election Department, and the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office. Several of these organizations also played a key role in the development and implementation of best practice policies for serving voters with disabilities in Arizona, and other input provided to election officials in Arizona concerning the needs of voters with disabilities.  



ACDL’s FY20 Work Protecting the Right of Arizonans with Disabilities to Cast a Private and Independent Vote 

In FY20, ACDL undertook a variety of activities aimed at protecting the right of Arizonans with disabilities to cast a private and independent vote. One such activity is the voting hotline that ACDL operates during city, county, state, and federal elections to assist callers in resolving access issues on Election Days, and ensuring every voter has an opportunity to cast a private and independent vote. ACDL operates the voting hotline during the hours the polls are open on Election Days. 

ACDL also provides assistance related to voting issues and representation in the enforcement of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, and other civil rights laws protecting the right to vote for people with disabilities. The following summary is one example of the continued enforcement work ACDL conducted as part of its PAVA program in FY20. 

ACDL began reporting in FY19 on its advocacy work in the case of K.H., who is an individual with physical disabilities including spinal stenosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and drop foot, which causes her difficulty with walking and standing. On Election Day, November 6, 2018, K.H. requested a reasonable accommodation – curbside voting. She went to two different voting centers in her County of residence and was denied curbside voting at each center. After visiting the second voting center, K.H. had no choice but to cast her vote there inside the voting center, or face being disenfranchised. K.H. thereafter contacted ACDL and we assisted K.H. in preparing a charge of discrimination against the County under the Arizona Civil Rights Act, for discrimination in voting on the basis of her disability. ACDL filed the charge of discrimination with the Arizona Attorney General’s Office Civil Rights Division (ACRD), and in FY20, represented K.H. during a position statement review on the charge in November 2019.

In May 2020, ACRD issued a dismissal notice for K.H.’s charge of discrimination without findings for either K.H. or the County, noting that the information obtained was not sufficient to establish violations of the Arizona Civil Rights Act. ACDL requested reopening of the proceedings, and a copy of the investigation file from which ACRD rendered its decision. After reviewing the file, surveying other counties and states about their policies on curbside voting, and identifying tools available to facilitate curbside voting, ACDL submitted an application for reconsideration to ACRD. The application for reconsideration discussed, among other things, how the curbside voting ban violates the Arizona Civil Rights Act, the availability of curbside voting in other Arizona counties, and the growing need for curbside voting for people with disabilities given the increasing threat of COVID-19. Unfortunately, ACRD upheld its decision and denied the application for reconsideration. ACDL is currently pursuing litigation against the County on this matter on K.H.’s behalf under another federal grant program. 


ACDL’s FY20 Work with Election Officials at the State, County, and Local Level to Ensure Access to the Electoral Process 

In FY20, ACDL conducted a number of activities with election officials to ensure access and improve the voting experience of people with disabilities in Arizona. For example, ACDL and the Maricopa County Recorder’s Office and Election Department (MRCO/ED) co-hosted Disability Roundtable meetings to facilitate discussion with, and provide feedback to, Maricopa County election officials concerning the needs and concerns of voters with disabilities. MCRO/ED also provided information relevant to voters with disabilities in attendance. MCRO/ED administers the fourth largest county election system in the United States, comprised of more than 2.5 million registered voters, and is responsible for ensuring that its elections are free, fair, and accessible to all voters in Maricopa County.  

In preparation for the 2020 General Election, ACDL and MCRO/ED co-hosted a Disability Roundtable on December 12, 2019. MCRO/ED provided the disability community with an overview of Arizona’s new election laws and how the new laws may impact Arizonans with disabilities’ access to the electoral process. ACDL and MRCO/ED co-hosted their first virtual Disability Roundtable on May 28, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Maricopa Recorder Adrian Fontes and other election officials discussed the steps they were implementing to protect voters in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, in preparation for the Arizona’s Primary Election and the General Election on November 3, 2020. Election officials also provided information on voting options for individuals concerned with voting in-person at the polls, including the expansion of voting options through Special Election Boards (bi-partisan teams that bring ballots to voters who are unable to come to a polling location due to illness or disability). Election officials also provided information about the additional steps the County would implement to protect the health and safety of voters, poll workers, and staff during in-person voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

ACDL also participated in the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office Election Officer Certification Training process in December 2019, and provided a training on ADA requirements for polling places and the election process for local election officers in Arizona.",,,,,

ACDL has developed collaborative, educational, enforcement, and best practice-based strategies to achieve our goal of ensuring full access to the electoral process. During Fiscal Year 2021, ACDL’s PAVA activities focused on the following on behalf of Arizonans with disabilities: increasing voter registration, increasing voter participation, increasing voter education opportunities, working with election officials to address the electoral needs of Arizonans with disabilities, protecting the rights of Arizonans with disabilities to ensure full access to the electoral process, and engaging in a GoVoter survey project. Further details concerning these activities are included below. 

ACDL Collaborates within the Community to Increase Voter Registration of People with Disabilities 

ACDL collaborated with several disability organizations to conduct voter rights trainings and voter registration drives activities in FY 2021. During our efforts, we identified several barriers that significantly impacted this project. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant negative impact on in-person voter registration. In-person voter registration activities have historically been the most effective way to reach out to potential voters with disabilities to increase registration.  

ACDL is part of the Arizona Disability Voter Coalition (AzDVC), which is a statewide partnership of individuals, stakeholders and organizations that work together to improve access to the electoral process for Arizonans with disabilities. AzDVC has incorporated the above six projects and works in collaboration with ACDL on achieving this shared goal of voter access for Arizonans with disabilities. The following are organizational members of AzDVC: ACDL, Citizens Clean Elections Commission, The Arc of Arizona, Southern Arizona Association for the Visual Impaired, Southwest Institute for Families and Children, Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered, Arizona Commission for the Deaf and the Hard of Hearing, Arizona Developmental Disabilities Planning Council, Arizona Association of Providers for People with Disabilities, Direct Advocacy & Resource Center, People First of Arizona, and others. The AzDVC met in March and August 2021 to coordinate efforts and activities in furtherance of enhancing the experience of voters with disabilities in Arizona. 

ACDL and AzDVC coalition partners conducted several voter registration activities on National Voter Registration Day and during National Disability Voter Registration Week. Among the activities conducted included a voting rights training by an ACDL attorney that included an overview of Arizona’s new voting-related laws, and provided participants with best practice strategies for people with disabilities to ensure access to the electoral process. Another organization participating in disability voter registration activities included the Arizona Department of Developmental Disabilities (DDD). DDD sent out more than 30,000 emails to its members and families to encourage them to register and vote. The Arizona Association of Providers for People with Disabilities (AAPDD) is Arizona’s largest consortium of developmental disabilities provider agencies, and made available voter registration information to all members with the consortium. Arizona Citizens Clean Elections, our independent Elections Commission, supported our efforts by providing logistics and resources.  


ACDL Works to Identify Barriers and Increase Voter Participation Among Voters with Disabilities in Arizona 

In FY 2021, ACDL collaborated with our AzDVC partners to identify barriers that impact the ability of a person with a disability to cast a private and independent vote in Arizona. Among the barriers identified were the need for various reasonable accommodations in the voting process to ensure full and equitable access. 

ACDL has reached out to state agencies and disability service provider agencies to inform them of their responsibilities to provide reasonable accommodations if needed, to ensure access to voting for Arizonans with disabilities. These accommodations may include assisting the person to update their voter registration, providing accessible transportation to the polls, and more. 

ACDL Conducts Trainings and Works to Increase Voter Education Opportunities for Arizonans with Disabilities 

In ACDL's efforts to provide statewide voting rights trainings to Arizonans with disabilities, we worked in collaboration with several disability organizations to conduct a number of virtual trainings on voting rights in FY 2021. The trainings and curriculums were designed and implemented to meet the needs of various disability stakeholder groups, including persons with intellectual/developmental disabilities. Some of the organizations ACDL partnered with to provide voter rights trainings included: Diverse Ability Incorporated, Youth Leadership Forum of Arizona, the University of Arizona Disability Cultural Center, Arizona Department of Developmental Disabilities, and more.  

Each of the four trainings ACDL conducted in June and July 2021 provided a basic overview of voting rights and provided detailed information on voting options and requesting accommodations to access the polls during the COVID-19 pandemic. American Sign Language interpreting and Closed Captioning were provided during all trainings. Collectively the trainings reached over 75 voters and prospective voters with disabilities in Arizona.  

ACDL also conducted voting rights trainings at Direct Advocacy & Resource Center (the independent living center for southern Arizona), a meeting of a local chapter of the National Federal for the Blind, the University of Arizona Disability Resource Center, and the Arizona’s Developmental Disabilities Advisory Council (DDAC) Public Forum. These trainings collectively reached over 96 individuals. 

ACDL Works with Election Officials to Address the Electoral Needs of Arizonans with Disabilities 

ACDL and our Disability Voter Coalition (AzDVC) partners worked very hard to build a working relationship with Arizona election officials at every level in the state. We have established a positive working relationship with the Arizona Secretary of State’s office and the majority of the County Recorders and Elections Departments throughout the state. Below is a summary of some of the activities ACDL conducted in FY 2021 to further its work in this area.  

During the fiscal year, ACDL and our AzDVC partners held meetings to discuss, develop and implement projects to improve access to the electoral process for Arizonans with disabilities. The majority of these meetings were attended by elections officials from the Secretary of State’s Office, and County Recorders Offices and Elections Departments. These meetings provided the disability community and elections officials with an opportunity to engage directly to discuss and resolve issues regarding access to the electoral process for voters with disabilities. 

Additionally in May 2021, ACDL and AzDVC partners met with the newly-elected Pima County Recorder and her team to discuss meeting the needs of voters with disabilities in Pima County, and to establish a working relationship with the office. As a result of the positive working relationship ACDL and its AzDVC partners have with election officials in the state, an AzDVC partner provided extensive feedback and recommendations on improving the accessibility of the official’s website at the request of one election official. Additionally, based on our working relationship, in June 2021, the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office invited ACDL to review and provide comments to the Arizona Elections Procedures Manual (Manual) concerning accommodating voters with disabilities.  ACDL provided the requested feedback concerning the Manual to help improve the accessibility of elections held in Arizona. 

ACDL also hosted its 10th Annual African American Conference on Disabilities in February 2021, in virtual format for the first time, and were honored to have Commissioner Thomas Hicks from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission as a keynote speaker for the closing session of the conference to speak about the critical importance of voting for the disability, and all, communities. The session had 293 Zoom participants, and 544 viewed through Facebook. 

ACDL Protects the Rights of Arizonans with Disabilities to Ensure Full Access to the Electoral Process 

In FY 2021, ACDL undertook a variety of activities aimed at protecting the rights of Arizonans with disabilities to cast a private and independent vote. One such activity was the voting hotline that ACDL operates during city, county, state, and federal elections to assist callers in resolving access issues on Election Days, and ensuring every voter has an opportunity to cast a private and independent vote. ACDL operates the voting hotline during the hours the polls are open on Election Days. On the November 2020 General Election, ACDL fielded a total of 41 calls, and was able to work with election officials in Pima County to address and resolve an accessibility barrier at a polling location through temporary remediation measures.  

ACDL also provides assistance related to voting issues and representation in the enforcement of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, and other civil rights laws protecting the right to vote for people with disabilities. 

ACDL Collaborates on GoVoter Survey Project 

ACDL, in collaboration with Self Advocates Becoming Empowered (SABE), conducted a GoVoter Survey Project to hear from Arizonans with disabilities regarding their voting experience in the November 2020 General Election. The goal of the survey was to obtain feedback from voters with disabilities and to provide the information and recommendations to election officials on improving access to the voting experience.  

ACDL conducted outreach activities to more than 30 disability organizations, including state agencies, to encourage them to support the survey and mail it to all to their constituents. Between November-December 2020, ACDL and SABE sent out over 120 emails to individuals and organizations prompting them to share and complete the survey. The survey was ultimately completed by 56 individuals and the data was utilized in a training that was attended by several election officials from various levels, including the Secretary of State’s Office and various County Recorders Offices and Elections Departments. 

ACDL also updated our voter education training curriculum for persons with disabilities based on data reported from the GoVoter experience survey results, to ensure the most current information and barriers are addressed in the trainings.",,,,,

Further details concerning these activities are included below.   

   

ACDL Collaborates with Community Partners to Increase Voter Registration of People with Disabilities   

ACDL and our AzDVC partners met on October 2, 2022 to coordinate our efforts and activities in preparation for the 2022 Arizona General Election. The meeting provided participants with an update on Arizona’s new elections laws and ways to enhance their voting experience and voting options.    

ACDL also collaborated with several disability organizations that are part of AzDVC to conduct voter rights trainings and voter registration drive activities for Arizonans with disabilities in FY 2023. During our efforts, we identified barriers that significantly impacted this project; the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant negative impact on in-person voter registration. In-person voter registration activities have historically been the most effective way to reach out to potential voters with disabilities to increase registration. In our efforts to continue our voter registration activities in a safe and secure manner, on February 18, 2022, ACDL applied for and was awarded a Unique URL link from the Arizona Secretary of State to conduct virtual voter registration activities. Under the Unique URL project, ACDL was given the authority to assign the Unique URL link to other nonprofit disability organizations to conduct nonpartisan voter registration activities. ACDL shared the Unique URL link with several organizations that are part of AzDVC to help amplify virtual voter registration efforts within Arizona and increase voter registration among people with disabilities. The Unique project operated from February 2022 through November 2022.      

ACDL and AzDVC coalition partners also conducted several voter registration activities on National Voter Registration Day and during Disability Voting Rights Week in FY23. Among the activities conducted included a voting rights training by an ACDL attorney that included an overview of Arizona’s new voting-related laws and provided participants with best practice strategies for people with disabilities to ensure access to the electoral process. In addition, ACDL and our AzDVC partners utilized various media platforms to disseminate voter education and voter registration information statewide to the disability community. Other organizations participating in disability voter registration activities included the All Voting is Local, the Arizona League of Women Voter. Maricopa County Recorder’s office and the Pima County Recorder’s office    


ACDL Works to Identify Barriers and Increase Voter Participation Among Voters with Disabilities in Arizona   
   
In FY 2023, ACDL collaborated with our AzDVC partners to identify barriers that impact the ability of a person with a disability to cast a private and independent vote in Arizona. Among the barriers identified were voter identification requirements and the need for various reasonable accommodations in the voting process to ensure full and equitable access.   

The lack of valid identification in order to register to vote prevents otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities from being able to engage in the democratic process. In our efforts to address this issue, ACDL and AzDVC partnered with VoteRiders, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose mission is to ensure that no eligible voter is prevented from casting a ballot due to voter identification laws. VoteRiders provides free services to assist the person in obtaining the necessary identification and documents to register to vote. In FY 2023, ACDL and AzDVC conducted a state-wide media campaign to inform the disability community of the services provided by VoteRiders, to provide a resource to help overcome this identified barrier.       

The ability to vote under limited guardianship and persons with disabilities living in group home settings were identified as barriers that impacted the capacity to cast a private and independent vote.    

As in previous years, in FY 2023 ACDL also reached out to various state agencies and disability service provider agencies in Arizona to inform them of their responsibilities to provide reasonable accommodations if needed, to ensure access to voting for Arizonans with disabilities. These accommodations may include assisting the person to update their voter registration, providing accessible transportation to the polls, and more. In addition, information was provided to these organizations on the use of the Special Elections Boards (Board) to assist voters who were unable to vote in person due to medical reasons. Two members from the Board would come to their home or place of choice to assist the individual in casting their vote.      

  

ACDL Conducts Trainings and Works to Increase Voter Education Opportunities for Arizonans with Disabilities   

In ACDL's efforts to provide statewide voting rights trainings in English and in Spanish to Arizonans with disabilities, we worked in collaboration with several disability organizations to conduct eighteen voting rights trainings in person and virtually in FY2023. The trainings were attended by 386 individuals from various locations throughout the state. The trainings and curriculums were designed and implemented to meet the needs of various disability stakeholder groups, including for example, trainings specifically designed for persons with intellectual/developmental disabilities. Some of the organizations ACDL partnered with to provide voter rights trainings included: Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered, Inclusive Empowerment Network, DiverseAbility Incorporated, Youth Leadership Forum of Arizona, and Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission, All Voting is Local, Arizona State University Ed Pastor Center for Politics, and Public Services, and Ability360.     

Each of the eighteen trainings ACDL conducted during FY 2023 provided a basic overview of voting rights and detailed information on voting options and requesting accommodations to access polling locations. The training included information on casting a ballot at home, in the hospital or a location that is convenient for the voter through Special Election Boards. Special Election Boards are administrated by each County Recorder’s Office and are made up of two members from differing political parties who travel to the location of a voter who is otherwise unable to access the polls, and are trained to assist the voter to cast their ballot in a secure, confidential, and accessible manner. American Sign Language interpreting and captioning were provided during all trainings.    

ACDL Works with Election Officials and the Governor’s Office to Address the Electoral Needs of Arizonans with Disabilities   

ACDL and our Disability Voter Coalition (AzDVC) partners worked hard to build a working relationship with Arizona election officials at every level in the state. We have established a positive working relationship with the Arizona Governor’s Office, Arizona Secretary of State’s office, Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission, and the majority of the fifteen County Recorders and Elections Departments throughout the state. Below is a summary of some of the activities ACDL conducted in FY 2023 to further its work in this area.    

On March 8, 2023, Arizona Governor, Katie Hobbs appointed Renaldo Fowler, Senior Staff Advocate, to her newly created Bipartisan Election Task Force. The Governor’s Bipartisan Elections Task Force consists of experts across Arizona’s elections community who represent political and geographic backgrounds from across Arizona. The goal of the Task Force was to review Arizona’s Electoral system and upon completion of its work, the Task Force will provide the Governor with recommendations on improving Arizona’s Electoral process. ACDL participation on the Task Force, was to ensure that voters and potential voters with disabilities needs were being address at the state level. Upon completion of the Task Force work, several recommendations were forward to the Governor to improve the voting experience for Arizonans. The most significant recommendation created by the Task Force that would impact persons with disabilities, is the creation of a Disability Resource Liaison.  This proposal recommended that the Disability Resource Liaison position be within the Secretary of State’s Office, have expertise and knowledge in various disability accommodations and resources. This person would provide technical assistance and help create resources on accessible voting materials, accessible voter websites, and accessible voting locations and procedures. This role would help create specific disability resources, including best practices and training information on disability etiquette. The creation of the Disability Resource Liaison was supported unanimously by all Task Force members.    

On March 3, 2023, The Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission established a Candidate Debate Work Group and requested ACDL participation on the work group. The Citizens Clean Elections Commission is a non-partisan commission created by voters that educates, voters, and provides campaign funding and enforces campaign finance rules and laws. Clean Elections has administered fair and effective debates for federal, state and legislative candidates for more than 20 years. The task of the work group was to examine the current processes and propose and discuss opportunities for updates and improvements. ACDL role on the Work Group was to ensure that issues that are important to persons with disabilities are embedded within this process.      

   

On September 5, 2023, Arizona Secretary of State, Adrian Fontes appointed Renaldo Fowler, Senior Staff to his Voter Engagement Advisory Board. The nonpartisan Board’s goal is to improve and expand voter register opportunities for all Arizonans. ACDL’s role is to educate and to ensure that Arizona Voters with Disabilities needs are addressed and incorporated into the work of the Board.   

   
During the fiscal year, ACDL and our AzDVC partners held meetings to discuss, develop, and implement projects to improve access to the electoral process for Arizonans with disabilities. Most of these meetings were attended by elections officials from the Secretary of State’s Office, Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission, and County Recorders Offices and Elections Departments. These meetings provided the disability community and election officials with an opportunity to engage directly with each other to discuss and resolve issues regarding access to the electoral process for voters with disabilities.   Some of the key issues discussed during the meetings included: maintaining and expanding access to voting; poll worker training and disability etiquette; creating and expanding voter education opportunities, including considerations for plain language materials and information; meeting the electoral needs of persons with disabilities living in group homes or other specialized settings; improving voter register opportunities; accessible voting equipment; and ensuring accessible polling locations.   
  

ACDL continues to education and collaborate with Arizona’s election officials and voter engagement organizations in developing and implementing effective communication protocols to ensure full access to the electoral process for Arizonans with disabilities. The disability community has frequently identified the lack of disability etiquette at polling locations, ineffective communication, and a general misunderstanding on how to meet the electoral needs of Arizonans with disabilities as issues that require continued work.",,,,,
CT,2021,"DRCT major sponsor of the Candidate Forum held on October 7, 2020.  DRCT assisted in preparing for the forum including preparing a flyer, a PAVA website page with recorded event and candidate booklet. DRCT staff also worked with its community partners at the forum to facilitate the forum and to sponsor part of the forum using PAVA funds.",,,,,
DC,2023,"*Priority 1*

During FY23, DRDC represented twelve (12) individual DC residents with disabilities under priority #1, including seven (7) individuals who we continued to represent in FY24.  Our representation focused on advocating for people with disabilities to obtain properly fitted wheelchairs, other durable medical equipment (DME) and assistive technology that maximizes their independence through the DC Medicaid Program and other DC government programs.  Of the five (5) individual cases DRDC closed in FY23 under priority #1, DRDC's advocacy work on behalf of individual Medicaid beneficiaries successfully secured access to medically necessary durable medical equipment (DME) and other assistive technology devices and services, resulting in community integration and independence, effective communication, and healthier, safer or otherwise improved environments.  One of these individual clients needed DME repairs to go to school and another client needed DME repairs to maintain employment.  Both clients were able to stay in school and remain employed as a result of DRDC's advocacy to advocate for wheelchair repairs.  DRDC achieved these end outcomes by: (1) removing barriers and helping clients navigate the bureaucratic steps to getting Medicaid authorization for needed assistive technology, (2) addressing rights violations and neglect by the staff charged to ensure access to DME, including staff at a local jail and nursing facility social worker staff, and (3) providing self-advocacy services to ensure a returning citizen understood the steps to obtain Medicaid authorization for DME upon his return to the community.  Some of those cases are described below.  

DRDC successfully represented a 33-year-old woman with an orthopedic impairment to obtain repairs on her motorized wheelchair under DC Medicaid.  Several months after DRDC successfully advocated for repairs in FY22, the client’s wheelchair required additional repairs.  DRDC successfully worked with her doctor and vendor to remedy a six-month delay to complete the proper documentation regarding her need for repairs.  DRDC also advocated with the vendor to request temporary fixes to the client’s chair until a repair authorization could be approved and completed.  As a result of DRDC’s advocacy, the client immediately received temporary fixes to enable her to continue the use of her wheelchair for employment and her activities of daily living until the vendor installed the parts to repair the client’s wheelchair.

DRDC represented a 61-year-old woman with orthopedic impairments that severely limit her movement.  She was using a manual wheelchair because her three-year-old motorized wheelchair had a dead battery and her case manager had failed to submit any repair request paperwork to the client’s vendor.  DRDC addressed this neglect with the case management agency administrator, who reassigned the client to a new case manager. Because the client’s existing chair has been discontinued, the new case manager worked with a new vendor to get Medicaid approval, order, and deliver a new motorized chair.  As a result of this successful advocacy, the client now has a brand-new motorized wheelchair that meets her needs.

Under DRDC’s Jail and Prison Advocacy Program, DRDC represented incarcerated District residents with mobility disabilities to enforce their right to durable medical equipment while incarcerated.  For example, DRDC assisted an individual incarcerated within the DC Department of Corrections (DOC) who required access to a wheelchair and other assistive devices to perform daily tasks.  After an altercation where the client briefly stood up, he was denied further access to a wheelchair and was moved to an inaccessible unit that required him to use stairs and denied him meaningful access to a shower.  DRDC contacted the Medical Director of DOC and the Medical Director of Corrections for the contracted organization that provides medical care in DOC to advocate for the client to return to a physically accessible unit and to give the client the use of a wheelchair.  He has used a wheelchair for more than a decade while incarcerated after the amputation of his foot and the onset of other health conditions that impacted his mobility.  The Directors denied DRDC’s repeated requests.  Over email, DRDC escalated the requests to DOC’s Office of General Counsel, the Deputy Directors, and the Director of DOC.  DRDC sent many emails explaining DOC’s legal obligations under the ADA and that denial of accommodations could not be used as a form of discipline.  After an in-person meeting with the Director and his deputies, the client was returned to his previous unit and given a wheelchair.

DRDC also continued to challenge the District’s improper termination of Medicaid home health services which threatened the loss of the requisite level of care to sustain Medicaid benefits coverage for some beneficiaries.  This loss of Medicaid eligibility, in turn, threatened to jeopardize beneficiaries’ access to durable medical equipment and assistive technology under DC Medicaid’s 1915(c) Waiver for the Elderly and People with Physical Disabilities (EPD) and through the Medicaid State Plan benefit.  Medicaid EPD Waiver beneficiaries can access the assistive technology of Environmental Accessibility Adaptation Services as well as Personal Emergency Response Services under the Medicaid State Plan.  To help ensure these beneficiaries will not lose access to this assistive technology, DRDC is engaging in systemic advocacy to challenge the District’s policy and practices of improperly terminating Medicaid services for many eligible Medicaid beneficiaries who are receiving long-term care and other Medicaid services.  After Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 ending the Medicaid continuous enrollment requirement, the DC Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) restarted the process of renewing Medicaid eligibility on April 1, 2023. 

In February 2023, DRDC sent a letter to DHCF requesting more information about its unwinding of the public health emergency (PHE) plan and educated DHCF about the elements of an accessible renewal and unwinding process, which is critical to help minimize the chance of wrongful Medicaid eligibility redetermination denials for individuals that remain eligible.  As a result of DHCF’s administrative renewal procedures, people with disabilities have lower renewal rates than other Medicaid groups to date.  For example, DHCF has a policy that long-term care or waiver beneficiaries, including individuals that receive EPD Waiver services, are not allowed to submit renewals on their own and must rely on a case manager to do so.  However, DHCF has acknowledged that case managers are failing to submit renewals in a timely manner.  DHCF has reported that approximately 1,600 Non-MAGI seniors and people with disabilities were procedurally terminated from Medicaid as of September 2023.  Of those 1600, the result of case manager inaction, in part, is that almost 200 EPD waiver beneficiaries are losing Medicaid eligibility for procedural reasons to date. 

In response in July 2023, DRDC sent another letter to DHCF regarding our serious concerns about the high rate of Medicaid beneficiaries that face procedural terminations, including long-term care beneficiaries who face termination because their case manager has failed to timely complete the renewal process.  DRDC also testified twice in February 2023 and September 2023 before the DC Council’s Committee on Health urging the Committee to ensure that DHCF provide reasonable accommodations for these beneficiaries with disabilities to remedy this discrimination, including by extending Medicaid eligibility and monitoring the impact of the Medicaid Renewal Process on this population.  At the request of the DC Council, DRDC provided a letter and met with the DC Council staff on the Committee of Health to educate them about DRDC’s policy priorities for the DC Department of Health Care Finance, including our priorities regarding the Medicaid renewal process. 

As a result of DRDC’s systemic advocacy, DHCF agreed to extend Medicaid coverage by 30 days for those beneficiaries due for renewal that are at risk of termination due to a non-response.  DHCF also modified its practices to monitor and track how many people with disabilities lose Medicaid coverage as a result of the Medicaid eligibility redetermination process, including tracking whether disability-based or associated eligibility categories are disparately impacted by procedural terminations (i.e., terminations because the beneficiary does not timely respond to a request for information).  After DRDC’s urging, DHCF also sent a curative notice to approximately 1,000 EPD waiver beneficiaries to rescind improper Medicaid termination notices sent in error due to a system issue.  Approximately 5,576 DC Medicaid long-term care beneficiaries who receive EPD waiver services’ access to Medicaid-funded DME and assistive technology services are affected by DRDC's advocacy.  These DC Medicaid long-term care beneficiaries are predominantly African-American.

*Priority 2*

DRDC represented two (2) individuals with disabilities under priority #2.  Our advocacy focused on advocating for full access for people with disabilities using assistive technology and other accommodations at polling places, governmental facilities, independent living, and public accommodations including at school and on public transportation.  For the one individual case we closed in FY23 under this priority, DRDC's advocacy work on behalf of this individual successfully secured access to assistive technology devices, resulting in the enforcement of their rights, discriminatory practices in assistive technology access modified, and private places and services were made more accessible through access to assistive technology.  This case and group advocacy are described below.  

DRDC successfully represented a 48-year-old man with an orthopedic impairment and autism to file a complaint against Union Station and Amtrak for denying him access to use a commuter scooter due to his mobility disabilities.  In the complaint, DRDC requested reasonable accommodations to remedy the station and Amtrak’s security’s unlawful denial of access to assistive technology when traveling at the station and on trains for people with disabilities, contrary to federal and local law and Union Station policy.  This advocacy resulted in an agreement by Union Station and Amtrak to grant his reasonable accommodation request to use his scooter at Union Station and on the trains. Specifically, the agreement, in part, requires that all staff and Union Station and Amtrak police are trained on the accommodation agreement and are provided a photo of the client and his scooter, so that he is not further mistreated by Union Station and Amtrak staff and police.  This is particularly important because the client is also an individual with Autism who is further at risk of harm when encountering the police.

In comprehensive comments covering nearly 800 pages of regulation changes to the public housing and Housing Choice Voucher programs, DRDC responded to proposed DC Housing Authority (DCHA) regulations that harm people with disabilities in the District, including regarding their access to auxiliary aids and services.  The regulations, which are currently in effect, make it harder for DCHA applicants and participants to access the assistive technology they need to have equal access to DCHA’s programs and services. For example, DRDC commented that DCHA must clarify in the regulations that video remote interpreting services will also be available to provide effective communication.  The proposed regulations also indicate DCHA will rely on outdated and unreliable technology like TTY (text telephone). Accordingly, DRDC commented that DCHA should amend these regulations to clarify that it will provide access to real-time text (RTT) communication.

During FY23, DRDC presented to 378 people with disabilities under both priorities about resources to access assistive technology, their rights under DC Medicaid regarding durable medical equipment, and about DRDC’S PAAT program, resulting in these people with disabilities and 6 total individuals whose cases were closed in FY23 under both PAAT priorities to have their rights enforced, retained, restored and/or expanded. 

For example, DRDC attended eight monthly meetings for Project Action, a large self advocacy group comprised of people with developmental disabilities.  At these meetings, DRDC presented to Project Action members on the services we provide, including assisting people with disabilities address issues obtaining assistive technology devices and durable medical equipment.  Approximately 50 people with disabilities attend these meetings. DRDC also presented to residents in nursing facilities, community residential facilities (CRFs), psychiatric facilities, public and private schools, public forums, the public library, day programs, and at a provider fair about the rights of individuals with disabilities to assistive technology.  For example, DRDC continued its close working relationship with the DC Public Library system to provide a hybrid online and in-person training for individuals with disabilities and others on the right to assistive technology and resources for obtaining assistive technology from various sources including schools, DDA, DC Medicaid, DC RSA, and employers.  DRDC trained 28 people with disabilities and staff at nursing facilities on assistive technology rights and resources in the nursing facility for people with disabilities like nurse call buttons through Medicaid.  

DRDC presented to children and youth in various institutional and community settings about their rights to assistive technology.  For example, DRDC trained youth at two Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services facilities multiple times to provide training and information to a total of 162 transition-age youth with disabilities incarcerated in these facilities to educate them on their rights to access needed assistive technology and durable medical equipment.  DRDC presented to 35 parents of transition-age youth with disabilities who attend nonpublic schools on the services available from the DC Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) and the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA).  This presentation included the assistive technology available through the Home and Community-Based Waiver for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and the assistive technology available through RSA, when necessary for people with disabilities to achieve their employment goal.  The presentation also addressed options for appeal if DDA or RSA denies individuals the assistive technology they need.  DRDC also conducted outreach and monitoring at the District’s two inpatient psychiatric facilities for children and youth, the Psychiatric Institute of Washington (PIW) and Children’s National Hospital. After being required to conduct outreach virtually for FY21 and FY22, due to COVID-19 visitation restrictions, DRDC was able to return to in-person outreach and monitoring at the start of FY23.  DRDC presented to 67 youth on a variety of topics, including DRDC’s advocacy and assistive technology and how it can be a useful tool in school, on the job, or for activities of daily living. 

DRDC widely distributed 309 flyers on assistive technology for DC residents with disabilities, which resulted in these individuals having their other rights enforced, retained, restored and/or expanded.  These flyers inform people with disabilities about their right to access medical equipment and assistive technology in the community and in health care settings, types of equipment available, and the process for obtaining these services under both Medicaid and for transition age youth.  The flyers also describe how people can contact DRDC if they encounter barriers.  For example, at the DDS Provider Fair, hosted at the DC Convention Center, DRDC tabled and distributed approximately 40 fliers about the PAAT program and rights to assistive technology under DC Medicaid (a conference for District residents with disabilities providing information and resources for accessing District services and supports).

As outlined more fully above, DRDC continued its group advocacy via in-person surveys of (97%) or 87 out of the 90 District vote centers during the 2022 General Election.  At each voting center surveyed, DRDC staff documented all structural and operational barriers and provided on-site recommendations to poll workers and the DC BOE staff to remove operational barriers, which included problems with the lack of assistive technology at electronic voting machines.

DRDC conveyed the survey findings on accessibility of vote centers and voting equipment for people with mobility, visual, and hearing disabilities by publishing its comprehensive written report in August 2023, describing accessibility issues across many vote centers that interfered with District voters with disabilities’ right to vote privately and independently and with assistive technology.  In addition to the survey results for the November 2022 General Election reported above under PAVA priorities, 5 of the surveyed vote centers (6%) lacked audio headsets at voting machines for voters with visual disabilities as compared to 18% of surveyed voting centers that lacked audio headsets at voting machines during the 2022 Primary Election.  As a result of DRDC’s on-the-spot recommendations, headsets and magnifying glasses were made available upon request at 12 vote centers, making the public vote centers more accessible.  As described above, DRDC shared the comprehensive General Election report with its recommendations to remedy the voting accessibility issues with the DC Board of Elections, the DC Council, the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights & Urban Affairs, the DC Consortium of legal services providers listserv, Restore the Vote Coalition, the public (via Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and website postings), and distributed it to visitors in our office.  

DRDC’s advocacy and polling accessibility reports for full voter access and accessibility benefits.  Approximately 70,230 adult DC residents have disabilities according to Census data, including the approximately 10,614 adult DC residents with developmental disabilities who were better able to participate fully in the electoral process due to DRDC's efforts to ensure access to assistive technology in the electoral process.  Of course, this 10,614 is a significant under-count of the approximately 48,000 adult DC residents with ambulatory disabilities who could benefit from DRDC’s work to ensure access to assistive technology in the electoral process.  The majority of our target population are minority populations by race and ethnicity.",,,,,

Outreach: 

DLP Director was interviewed by Delaware News Journal on results of polling place accessibility on May 8, 2023 (https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/05/08/delaware-polling-places-lack-ada-accessibility-disabilities-law-program/70187792007/). 

On October 7, 2023, Delaware’s newly enacted election laws that established same-day registration and vote-by-mail were struck down as unconstitutional by the Delaware Supreme Court.  This necessitated an important and urgent rush to update the online Voter Guides (https://www.aclu-de.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/dvrc_voter_guide_english-_general_election.pdf) to reflect the changes brought about by the court’s decision.  DLP staff worked closely with the Delaware Voting Rights Coalition (DVRC) and its communications committee on this effort, and on distributing electronic copies to the network of agencies and individuals working with persons with disabilities, to help ensure they were well-informed and aware of the implications of the changes. DLP staff worked with individual cases of accessibility in the voting process and uncovered barriers in the electronic return of absentee ballots for voters with low vision or blindness. DLP alerted the Department of Elections to the issue, and in the interim, was successful in helping a client with visual impairment to receive her absentee ballot and successfully return it in time to the Department of Elections. 

Presentations

GU,2023,"GLSC-DLC developed social media outreach and posted information on our website on voter rights. We also provided posters and brochures with information about our PAVA program. Election officials disseminated the brochures that provided more information on our program, voting rights, and whom to contact should they have any issues while voting. Moreover, GLSC-DLC promoted early voting, homebound voting, and accessible voting on election day options for voters with disabilities, as well as the ExpressVote, a universal voting system for casting a ballot. 

As with past elections, GLSC-DLC provided two (2) assistive technology toolkits to all 67 precincts to assist voters with disabilities in casting their votes.  The toolkits included a description of all the low-tech devices available for voter use. In addition, toolkits were also provided at the early voting sites in the northern, central and southern villages, as well as the hotel venue selected for early voting.",,,,,
HI,2020,"PAVA conducted 60 visits to distribute ""Go Vote"" posters and advertise to underserved communities.

PAVA provided 56 trainings to schools, facilities and other community centers to education potential voters.

PAVA distributed 579 voter education materials to the community, HDRC applicants and clients.

PAVA opened 126 individual cases to provide technical assistance and representation to people with disabilities who requested to register to vote.

PAVA embarked on its broadest, most coordinated effort in Fiscal Year 2020.  Statewide interest in the 2020 electoral process mirrored nationwide interest in the Presidential election.  We also witnessed people with disabilities get swept into the electoral fervor.  PAVA’s comprehensive campaign had three major prongs:

1.  Voter Registration.  Individuals with disabilities were asked if they were able to access the voter registration process.  Every applicant for HDRC’s services – even persons who did not qualify for programmatic services -- was approached to register to vote.  Every HDRC employee wore a 4” button that said “I Can Help You Vote,” and HDRC’s office also posted several red, white and blue banners that bore the same message.  Each PAVA advocate kept a stack of voter registration forms on their person.  Despite lockdowns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, over 120 individuals with disabilities completed and submitted voter registration forms, and many more received registration forms in the mail.

2.  Media Campaign.  Social media, newspaper and radio advertising, bus placards and televised public service announcements all empowered people with disabilities to have a voice in the electoral process.  

Newspaper ads were created and published in each island’s major newspaper.  Twenty four radio stations ran a total of 2,661 spots during drive time, aggregating 5,753,100 impressions.  Radio advertising also created opportunities for live interview spots on each island and PAVA would accept every opportunity.  Bus placards were placed in 50 buses whose routes travel primarily through underserved Filipino and Pacific Islander communities.  The PSA videos were run on public television and also posted on HDRC’s website and Facebook page.  

3.  Monitoring Access.  Systems cases were opened to monitor polling place and ballot accessibility.  It was a small surprise when Hawaii closed all but a handful of polling places and moved to a mail-in ballot system.  Nevertheless, PAVA applied the same standard of accessibility to evaluate the entire mail-in ballot process.  The two remaining polling places on Oahu (city hall and a satellite city hall) were monitored and observed for physical and programmatic access.  

From PAVA’s individual case files:

H.L. is a 78-year old blind woman who wanted to register to vote.  She had misplaced or lost her identification, which we are informed is a common occurrence for people with blindness.  H.L. called city hall and a variety of agencies, and was advised that she could not register to vote without presenting valid identification.  She finally contacted HDRC for assistance, reaching out to a PAVA advocate who is a board member of a local blind organization.  The PAVA advocate researched the issue and learned that all H.L. needed to register to vote was the last four digits of her Social Security number.  The PAVA advocate arranged to meet H.L. at the city hall polling place.  He ushered her through the registration process where she recited the last four digits of her SSN, and then he escorted her to an accessible electronic voting machine where H.L. cast her primary vote.

While at the polling place, the PAVA advocate noted thick cables run across several pedestrian paths.  He identified the trip hazard and asked the precinct official to have the cables moved.  The cables were re-routed minutes later.",,,,,
HI,2021,"In FY21, PAVA embarked on its broadest most-comprehensive effort to reach the entire disability community and its un- and underserved segments, which was largely successful.  The 2020 elections marked the State of Hawaii’s full migration to a mail-in ballot system.  Generally, the mail-in voting system met with approval by our disabled population.  However, there were some challenges.  To address these challenges, PAVA continued the comprehensive three-prong campaign initiated in the FY20 primary election:

1. Voter Registration:  Every applicant for HDRC services, regardless of whether their case was accepted or not, received a follow phone call to inform each individual of their right to vote, along with the offer of PAVA’s registration assistance.  COVID-19 restrictions hampered typical in-person outreach efforts, however we were able to provide PAVA information at our community vaccination clinics, via Facebook and our website.  Advocates continued to work with high schools and community colleges as well for PAVA outreach.  At last count, over 140 individuals with disabilities who may have never registered to vote were registered through PAVA’s efforts.  

PAVA’s voter registration campaign continues to the present, where each week’s telephone and email applicants for services are called to ask if (1) they are able to access the voter registration process, and (2) whether they would like PAVA to assist them with voter registration.

2. Media Campaign.  For the 2020 primary and general elections, PAVA enlisted multiple media resources for voter education and specifically targeted our disabled and underserved populations.  In a first time effort, HDRC produced a video for social media highlighting how HDRC could assist with the registration process, emphasizing that “your vote counts”.  Our PAVA educational video was produced both in English and Tagalog and captioned for the deaf/hard of hearing.  The social media results exceeded our expectations with over 35,000 Facebook “likes”!  The same messages of “you have the right to register and vote” and “your vote counts” was recorded as a public service announcement for public television.  Newspaper ads were placed in the major daily newspapers for each island to offer PAVA’s assistance with registration and voting, and similar messages were advertised on local radio stations, translated into Chuuk, Tagalog and Ilocano.  Various PAVA staff were also offered informational/PSA spots on local television news shows, public television, and numerous top-rated radio shows.  

3. Enforcing Accessibility to the Mail-In Ballot.  PAVA’s third emphasis was to monitor the newly-instituted mail-in balloting system to ensure its access to people with disabilities.  Many of the accessibility issues that arose and corresponding advocacy goals and objectives were incorporated as part of PAVA’s Systems Cases (see narrative below).  

 
PAVA Systems Cases: Accessible Mail-In Voting and Monitoring Access to Polling Places.  

The State of Hawaii’s move to a mail-in balloting system meant that traditional precinct polling sites were closed and replaced with a limited number of “Voting Service Centers (VSCs).”  PAVA applied the same standard of accessibility to evaluate the new VSCs and the mail-in ballot process as well as the on-line alternatives.  

Issues and accessibility concerns arose during the November 2020 General Election.  On Oahu, individuals who either missed the mail-in registration deadline or desired to vote in-person were forced to drive to the only two polling places that remained open.  Voters with disabilities had to take public transportation like TheBus or TheHandi-Van and travel a considerable distance outside of their neighborhood, only to experience hours-long lines on Election Day.  Individuals with disabilities appeared to be disproportionately impacted.  The offer of same-day registration and voting also overburdened the voter confirmation staff and computers, and contributed to the lengthy delays for in-person voters.  To address these issues, PAVA is working with state and county elections offices for expanded PSCs for the next election. 

Additionally, voters with blindness and low vision were directed to the Office of Elections websites for online voter registration or alternate ballots.  Some of the online forms and web text used were not accessible to blind/low vision voters who attempted to use their reading machines.  PAVA reported these issues to the Office of Elections, a temporary fix was found, and a more permanent solution is under discussion.

When voters expressed concern whether their mail-in ballots would be received timely and counted, the Office of Elections implemented a system of drop boxes strategically positioned around Oahu.  Similar drop boxes were instituted in a more limited fashion on the neighbor islands.  PAVA received a few complaints about the lack of drop box accessibility to the blind (due to the lack of Braille signage) and to the mobility impaired (due to the positioning of the slots on the drop boxes and/or the overall lack of convenience of some drop box locations).  PAVA reported these issues to the Office of Elections and will collaborate with them to enhance drop box accessibility in future elections.  

PAVA’s systems cases have in past years generated favorable conditions and accessibility for voters with disabilities.  However, the systems case to monitor polling places will be closed due to its limited applicability in the current voting environment.

D.S. is a 59-year Oahu male who is blind and could not fully access the mail-in voting system.  The new mail-in ballot required the voter to sign a specific area on the outside of the privacy envelope before it is placed in the mailing envelope.  For blind voters, there were no braille or physical identifying marks to indicate where to sign.  Incorrectly signed privacy envelopes would be rejected.  D.S. attempted to resolve the issue with the Office of Elections prior to the 2020 primary election, and when he was unable to do so, he contacted PAVA.  A PAVA Advocate worked with D.S., other members of the blind community, and the Office of Elections to design accessible privacy envelopes for future blind/low vision voters.",,,,,
HI,2023,PAVA provided assistance to 99 individuals with disabilities with request to register to vote.,,,,,
ID,2020,"The purpose of this project was to record the work DRI has done in response to the election changes in 2020 and voter access to individuals with disabilities. On April 1, 2020, the Governor of Idaho issued a proclamation regarding the May 2020 primary – changing it to an all absentee-mail ballot process. DRI grew concerned that this process may negatively impact persons with disabilities, esp. those with print disabilities.

DRI staff reached out to the Deputy Sec of State to discuss concerns, esp. around the lack of information being provided/advertised regarding the new election changes. As a result, the Sec of State’s office agreed to issue a press release as well as a Facebook Live presentation/press conference explaining the election changes and communicating a commitment to ensuring that voters with disabilities would have access to vote. DRI staff then researched county websites for accommodations information and found little to none.

DRI staff then communicated with DOJ attorneys in Washington and eventually filed a DOJ Complaint regarding our concerns. The American Council of the Blind (ACB) and the National Federation of the Blind of Idaho (NFB) also filed supplementary complaints, detailing individual experiences in regards to this election change. (NDRN staff connected ACB with DRI). The ACB and DRI released a press release regarding their complaints. ACB and DRI also did a podcast regarding the complaint filing process.
DRI staff reached out to various stakeholder agencies in Idaho to see if they had received complaints/concerns about the election process from their constituents. DRI staff also reached out to other P&A staff in states where absentee/mail in voting has been performed on a regular basis, to inquire as to their process, accommodations, etc.

DRI edited the PAVA paragraph in its letters with updated election information re: the May 2020 primary election. This paragraphs goes out to all I&R, IRNE, TA and closing letter sent from DRI. DRI also posted election process updates on the DRI website as well as press releases.

DRI also collaborated with 2 volunteer attorneys in Idaho who were working on an elections accessibility project for a leadership academy – sharing information and suggestions on things to look into and research to help promote voting accessibility, esp. in rural areas.
DRI staff were invited to present at the NDRN Virtual Conference in June 2020 in regards to DRI’s experience in filing a DOJ complaint re: voting accessibility concerns.

DRI staff also did a presentation to the local NFB chapter members on the DOJ complaint it had filed re: election accessibility concerns and paired it with a presentation on voting rights for persons with disabilities.

DRI staff also communicated with the Assistant US Attorney for Idaho regarding DRI’s concerns in the elections process and to get updates on DOJ’s movement on the complaint that was filed.

In August of 2020, the Governor convened a special session of the legislature to discuss proposed legislation related to the November election and another COVID-related issue. DRI staff reviewed the legislation, drafted and then submitted written testimony regarding its continued concerns regarding election accessibility. This was then turned into an Op-Ed article that was published in the Idaho Falls Post Register in August of 2020, in collaboration with the NFB of Idaho.",,,,,
ID,2021,"FY21 PAVA Activities Project Summary

In FY21, DRI staff conducted the following activities in regards to the November 2020 general election:

- Developed a new, updated TA letter to send to callers re voting issues with information, referrals and resources specific to the Nov. 2020 gen election, including info on voter registration and ways in which to cast a ballot in the Nov. 2020 election in Idaho;

- Provided information on voting rights, voter registration and voting options as an outreach to THRIVE for them to use in a training for young adults with disabilities who participate in their program at the Meridian YMCA;

- In-person early voting location monitors at 4 early voting locations (Ada County (2) and Bannock and Bingham Counties);

- Met, consulted with other stakeholder agencies such as the Independent Living Centers, NW ADA Center, and League of Women Voters to discuss/address transportation barriers for voters with disabilities. Information gathered from these meetings on transportation options for voters with disabilities in Idaho was then incorporated into DRI’s 2020 General Election newsletter which was widely distributed amongst stakeholder groups and published on the DRI website;

- Provided Idaho AT Advisory Council with an update on issues/concerns related to voting/voting technology for persons with disabilities for their October 2020 meeting;

- Presented at the SILC Quarterly Business meeting in October 2020 on rights of voters with disabilities and updates for the 2020 November election;

- Provided an attorney consult to the Chief Civil Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for Latah County on accommodations for persons who can’t wear a face covering at the polling place for their elections clerk. DRI staff provided them with resources and analysis on this topic as well as DOJ press release on the topic;

- Consulted with stakeholder agencies such as SILC, NW ADA Center, and the National Fed of the Blind of Idaho on COVID safety concerns for voters with disabilities after it was reported that COVID outbreaks had occurred in early voting locations where masks, social distancing, etc. were not being mandated. DRI staff attempted to bring this to the attention of the Secretary of State who refused to issue any sort of orders with such requirements for county clerks to implement, leaving it up to each individual county clerk to decide how to implement the recent CDC guidance for polling locations. Frustrated with this lack of initiative, DRI staff spoke with a Channel 6 news reporter who was interested in doing a story on this as well as voting barriers for persons with disabilities during COVID and also connected the reporter with individuals to interview – to ultimately bring public awareness to this issue so that voters with disabilities could be informed and make safe choices regarding how to vote in the Nov 2020 election;

- Emailed all 44 county clerks to share updated CDC guidance for voting locations and to encourage them to implement such measures to ensure the safety of Idaho voters, including those with disabilities during early voting and on election day;

- Created, published and distributed copies of a 2020 General Election Newsletter (see attached), with information on the 2020 general election, including transportation options, voting rights for persons with disabilities, voting options, deadlines, COVID safety tips, and hotline info. The newsletter was provided to the state independent living center, all other independent living centers, the NW ADA Center, the Idaho League of Women Voters, the Idaho AT Project, ICDVI, and was published to the DRI website.

- Collaborated with Idaho Women Lawyers and University of Idaho Law student volunteers who agreed to conduct in-person election day monitoring in various location in Canyon County – DRI Director of Legal & Advocacy Services provided them with polling place accessibility checklists and then encouraged them to call DRI on election day to immediately report any concerns. A volunteer contacted DRI on election day to report accessibility issues at a polling place location including the need including the need for better curbside voting signage; lack of accessible voting booth inside the location; lack of staffing to monitor the curbside voting; and an overall lack of COVID protocols being followed. DRI PAVA attorney then called and reported the concerns to the Elections Supervisor for the county who indicated she would immediately contact the staff at the polling location and get the issues resolved as soon as possible. Thanks to this collaboration, thousands of voters in this precinct were provided with more accessible and more COVID-friendly voting options.

- Hosted a voter hotline on election day, Nov. 3, 2020, from 8 AM- 8 PM in order to answer all voter-related calls on election day;

- And as a result of DRI's collaboration with various stakeholders during the ADA30 Celebration, DRI became a member of an on-going committee called Idaho Voting Coalition, to discuss various voting accessibility concerns, issues, ways in which to help increase voter turnout within the disability community. DRI, the ILCs, the Idaho Access Project, and the NW ADA Center are members of this Coalition.",,,,,
ID,2023,"PAVA attorneys and staff attended conferences with the Idaho Federation of the Blind and gave a presentation and collected stories of accessibility issues from blind or low-vision voters.

The PAVA attorney met with the Idaho Secretary of State to provide feedback on the last federal election, and other elections officials including Ada County elections director and County Clerks throughout Idaho who are responsible for running local election polling sites. The PAVA attorney also met with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to discuss the closure of the 2020 complaint regarding absentee voting problems. The DOJ decided to close the case, but said it was willing to continue to collect stories. The P&A PAVA attorney and staff worked throughout the year to address voting barriers for voters with disabilities and ensure full participation in the local process. It was important for DRI to conduct these activities to ensure the rights promised by the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Help America Vote Act, and other applicable laws and to build consensus with stakeholders, the Department of Justice and elected officials to address voting barriers, build consensus for addressing those barriers, and build a PAVA program that works collaboratively with each party.

Stemming from the last federal election, the PAVA attorney attended webinars with REV-UP, National Disability Rights Network (NDRN) and Self Advocates Becoming Empowered (SABE). The PAVA attorney also met with and shared other PAVA plans with other PAVA coordinators by attending NDRN open office meetings and meeting with individuals from other states. There were no cases accepted this fiscal year in PAVA. P&A PAVA attorney met with stakeholders at National Federation of the Blind Idaho (NFB-Idaho) and local living independent network and the Idaho League of Women voters to collaborate on a work plan to address absentee voter issues. The PAVA attorney identified sections of law that addressed absentee voting and identified paths for correction for the collaboration. The PAVA attorney also presented information at the annual NFB-Idaho conference and collected information regarding problems with accessibility at polls. The PAVA attorney later shared that information with the Department of Justice (DOJ) after the clients consented to such disclosure. The PAVA attorney also discussed the closure of the complaint with the DOJ but continues to work with the DOJ regarding the collection of stories and potential re-opening of the complaint. The PAVA attorney also researched electronic voting in other states and other implementation programs. The PAVA attorney furthered ideas for electronic voting by collaborating with stakeholders to garner more stories regarding difficulties voters with disabilities were having and meeting with both the Secretary of State and the election director in the largest county to discuss the potential of implementing such a program. These programs are ongoing.",,,,,
IL,2023,"EFE has approached the Illinois State Board of Elections (“SBE”) leadership multiple times over past years to enter into a collaboration with us to ensure greater statewide accessibility of polling places.   We designed an electronic ADA polling place survey app for this purpose, which is flexible enough to be used by any Illinois election district, and which can be used offline – without any live internet connection -- which is critical for use at widespread, urban and rural, polling places on Election Days.  In addition to the use of this state-of-the-art app, we have offered intensive and multi-platform training for local election authorities, as well as updates to the SBE’s website reference materials for voters with disabilities. 

Despite our attempts to establish this collaboration, in FY 21, the SBE declined to contract with EFE for ADA survey-related services, in favor of building an in-house SBE survey instrument.  No such instrument appears to have been built, and SBE’s website, which historically provided polling place accessibility information (albeit incomplete and inaccurate) for each election authority, is now devoid of any information.

In FY22 and FY23 EFE has been unable to re-establish a relationship on this issue with the SBE because it was necessary for us to focus our efforts with the SBE on statewide improvements in accessible vote-by-mail systems for the federal 2022 elections.  For the same reason – required focus on accessible vote-by-mail – EFE did not approach any local election authorities to create an ADA survey program (other than the City of Chicago Board of Elections, with which EFE has been working for several years; see PAVA Goal #1) in FY23. Between the summer of 2020 and FY 2023, EFE has been working with a group of disability rights and voting rights organizations to establish accessible vote-by-mail programs throughout the state of Illinois.  Our efforts have brought the state from having vote-by-mail being offered only in hard copy – and thus entirely inaccessible to people who are blind, low vision, or who have other print disabilities – to currently having partial accessibility.  Currently, election authorities are required by a 2022 state law to offer voters the ability to receive and mark their ballots electronically, but they must still print out and return ballots in hard copy.  Also currently, the State Board of Elections facilitates this mandate by contracting with a vendor to create electronic ballots for local election authorities to use free of charge to allow their print-disabled constituents to vote with at least partial accessibility.

Since that achievement, EFE and our collaborating organizations have been working to research and confirm the security of allowing electronic return of completed ballots.  Only with electronic return can we people with disabilities have full access, independence, and privacy throughout the voting process.

Note: any lobbying activities incidental to this goal and priorities were undertaken without the use of PAVA Funds. EFE only accomplished a small part of this initiative in FY23 – that of assisting 2 residents of McFarland (now named Packard) residential facility for people with mental illness with registering and voting by mail.  (See above PAVA Goal 4, Inform and advocate for individual persons with disabilities throughout the State regarding their right to vote and procedures for registering and voting.)  We ran short of PAVA funds for this work due to the unusual number of elections the occurred in FY23 and the unprecedented amount of preparation and survey work required for those uniquely complex post-pandemic, post-redistricting elections. EFE plans to further flesh out and implement this initiative in FY24.",,,,,
KY,2023,"Kentucky Protection and Advocacy was contacted by State Board of Elections (SBE) General Counsel regarding the development of an SBE website.  The website was going to launch a new tab with information regarding voting with disabilities.  Prior to the launch of the website, SBE submitted a draft copy of all of the information the intend to share.  This include how to request an absentee ballot, who qualifies for an absentee ballot in Kentucky, and who to contact if individuals had questions.  The PAVA coordinator with Kentucky Protection and Advocacy, as well as two of the attorneys with Kentucky Protection and Advocacy reviewed the information provided for accuracy of the information.  Kentucky Protection and Advocacy then responded to SBE with our approval and support.",,,,,
MA,2020,"DLC, in collaboration with members of the DD Council, continues to support Anne Fracht as the President and member of the Board for Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered (SABE) and the GoVoter Project. 

With it being a Presidential Election, extensive work on the REV UP MA Project was conducted in FY 2020. This work was conducted under the PAVA program and included a large day-long REV UP conference featuring national speakers. This work has been reported to ACL under the PAVA PPR.",,,,,
MA,2021,"Priority 1: DLC will support self-advocates to ensure people with developmental disabilities know about their voting rights and have access to voting. 

 

DLC, in collaboration with members of the DD Council, continues to participate on the Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered (SABE) Advisory Council and contribute input on their GoVoter Project initiative. During FY2021, extensive work was done on the REV UP MA Project. This work was conducted under the PAVA program and will be reported to ACL under the PAVA PPR. 

 

 

Priority 2: DLC will support self-advocates who are examining the benefits of supported decision making (SDM) as an alternative to guardianship. 

 

Massachusetts Advocates Standing Strong (MASS) has been leading a task force on Supported Decision Making. MASS has used the task force to explore the types of laws and policies available, nationwide, that if implemented, can help persons with developmental disabilities in MA make more of their own decisions. As a result of the Task Force’s efforts, legislation was filed this year to establish a supported decision-making option for individuals with I/DD and other disabilities. MASS, DLC, ICI, the Shriver Center, the Center for Public Representation and the Harvard Project on Disability collaborated on educating self-advocates on supported decision- making. 

As with the prior year, DLC continued to actively participate on the MA Supported Decision Making (SDM) Task Force during FY2021. DLC provided advocacy guidance and support to MASS members on the proposed SDM bill.  While COVID-19 did slow down the process, DLC has remained behind the scenes supporting self-advocates in their role of educating the public and the MA legislative body on SDM and how SDM can provide self-advocates with the autonomy that they are missing when placed under guardianship. Some of this work is conducted using non-federal funds.",,,,,
MD,2021,"PAVA staff adjusted to reviewing the placement and location of ‘ballot boxes’ for the 2020 General Election.  PAVA staff received twelve complaints from community members regarding the placement of ballot boxes in inaccessible locations.  While PAVA staff successfully resolved complaints by contacting state and local board of elections, there appeared to be a lack of guidance regarding the placement of ballot boxes. PAVA staff will be asking the State Board of Elections on any guidance or direction that has been provided to local board of elections regarding placement and location of ballot boxes.

As part of continuing efforts to ensure access to accessible voting systems, DRM has collaborated with NFB to advocate for increased usage of accessible ballot marking devices (BMDs).  DRM and NFB successfully advocated to increase the minimum number of voters that use the BMD from two voter per precinct, which was the policy from 2016-18, to 5 voters per precinct. After reviewing the results from the 2020 special elections it is clear that the policy change was not enough to ensure the rights of disabled voters. In 2020, precincts still reported underutilization of the BMDs. This compromises the privacy of persons with disabilities ballot choices. Consequently, DRM will continue to advocate for the Maryland General Assembly to require the SBE to address these issues and propose possible solutions to increase ballot secrecy. PAVA staff conducted virtual voter outreach and “Know Your Rights” presentations.  PAVA staff tailored the presentation to its audience presenting live using a PowerPoint Presentation, recording presentation for future dissemination, and attending open forum telephone conversations.  These events were designed to reach a cross disability audience that was geographically diverse with the state attendees includes people with disabilities, voting rights advocates, and processionals that work with people with disabilities.  Over 200, people logged into at least one of DRM’s presentation.  The presentations were hosted by Centers for Independent Living, support groups, and professional. PAVA Staff participated in an election rights ‘boiler room’ on Election Night 2020 with other state civil rights organizations, including the ACLU, Common Cause, PIRG, and others. As area experts, PAVA provided technical assistance to state and local boards of election to remedy inaccessibility issues at polling locations. PAVA staff responded to inquires from State and local board of elections regarding the placement of ballot boxes and ensuring that such placement is accessible.",,,,,
MD,2023,"PAVA Staff along with volunteers from the Everyone Votes Coalition engaged in voter outreach at Maryland State Psychiatric Hospital, Spring Grove, on October 11,  and successful registered 96 people and assisted residents requested 102 mail in ballots throughout the hospital. The majority of residents at Maryland State Psychiatric Hospital are currently being held in relation to involvement with the criminal legal system, and the majority of residents are black and/or African American. PAVA Staff participated in the planning committee for a Voter’s Forum hosted by the Maryland Disabilities Forum on October 5, 2022, to present questions and issues for Maryland's gubernatorial candidates to respond to. The Forum was posted online and received approximately 1045 views and streams. PAVA Staff partnered with Life After Release, a formerly incarcerated women led organization focused on assisting formerly incarcerated women upon release and navigating life post-conviction. Our voter registration collaboration focused on areas where formerly incarcerated women may encounter such as state benefit offices. PAVA staff attended a Resource Fair hosted by DRM on the Eastern Shore and provided information on voter registration and planning for voting. PAVA Staff partnered with People Power of Maryland to register individuals with disabilities to vote. PAVA staff co-hosted a seminar on voting rights for persons with disabilities at the Kennedy Krieger Institute. PAVA Staff partnered with members of the Everyone Votes Coalition this program year to educate members of the barriers facing people with disabilities in voting, this included recruiting members of the Coalition to review accessibility of drop-box locations, assisting in registration of voters in state psychiatric hospitals, and partnering with other voter rights agencies in their outreach efforts. PAVA Staff met bi-weekly with staff from the State Board of Elections to raise and address any potential issues that would create barriers to voting for persons with disabilities. The sessions have been helpful in proactively addressing issues that may arise to ensuring an accessible voting system. PAVA Staff operated DRM's Voter Hotline and E-mail and also provided technical assistance to the Voter Hotline operated by the Everyone Voters Coalition. Through these Services PAVA Staff fielded 16 calls from voters and provided feedback in real time to the local and state board of elections. PAVA Staff prepared material for the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman to Share with local Ombudsman office to better inform residents of their voting rights while residing in long-term care facilities. PAVA Staff provided comments to the State Board of Elections (SBE) Administrative Complaint process to advocate for increased accessibility of SBE's Administrative Complaint Process.  These comments included i) having the complaint form be available in multiple languages; ii) the option to complete submit the complaint form electronically; and iii) the option to have any hearings on complaints conducted electronically. SBE accepted these recommendations from PAVA staff.",,,,,
ME,2020,"DRM staff attorney was interviewed by the Portland Press Herald regarding voting access barriers in Maine and the purposes of the HAVA and our PAVA project.

MI,2020,"According to Lisa Schur of Rutgers University, 1/7 of Michigan’s 7.5 million registered voters (over 1.7 million, or about 295 per precinct) have disabilities. DRM engaged in a number of PAVA activities to improve access to the electoral system for voters with disabilities.

DRM voting rights and voter engagement activities took place in the context of one national election and two statewide primaries and featured for the first-time constitutional changes that guaranteed Michigan voters the right to no-reason absentee voting and same-day voter registration. The national election included legal standards and conditions, especially around voting by mail, that changed daily.

DRM Advances Voting Rights in an Election Year

DRM staff participated on two statewide elections commissions on cybersecurity and election modernization. We collaborated on several training pieces for improving access to voting with Michigan State University, the Bureau of Elections, American Civil Liberties Union, and Rooted in Rights. DRM also provided successful Lansing-area clerks’ training in a jurisdiction serving approximately 4,640 adult voters with disabilities (32,481 x .14). (Project #s 98676, 98678) 

DRM co-sponsored the collaborative Michigan Election Protection website and hotline, designed to provide nonpartisan, accurate information about voting rights to all voters, including voters with disabilities. DRM, the Brain Injury Association of Michigan (BIAMI), DD Council, Disability Network, Michigan State University’s Usability Access Center, Michigan Disability Rights Coalition and the Bureau of Elections created a voting rights Facebook group and online event running from July through October. The Bureau also began work on a sensitivity training video for election workers to be included in training workshops and made part of the Bureau's online video catalog. DRM was tasked with developing the communications and marketing plan and assisted in reviewing the video scripts. The video was due for completion in October 2020.

DRM Promotes Voter Registration and Conducts Social Media Outreach

DRM continued to leverage its high number of information and referral calls by including in its Client Satisfaction Survey an invitation to request voter registration information. In FY 2020 DRM sent out 46 voter registration packets as requested by eligible callers.

DRM engaged in extensive social media coverage on voting rights and voter engagement, reaching 17,394 people through its nonpartisan informational postings. 


DRM Handles Voting Concerns of Individuals

DRM responded to several I&R calls about voting, including:
• A caller who wanted to share DRM information with the SABE “GoVote” project; we encouraged her to do so. (SR# 2050250) 
• the same caller wanted information and had questions about applying to become a member of Michigan’s state voting redistricting commission. (SR# 2055185)
• A caller with questions/concerns regarding accessibility at a Wayne County polling site. The clerk provided assurances that the site would be in an accessible location at the next election. (SR# 2081624)
• A call from the resident of a psychiatric hospital who had general questions about voting; that person was referred to the hospital social worker, the Election Protection Hotline, and the recipient rights officer. (SR# 2104282) 
• A caller who had a paper allergy and needed information on alternatives to registration and online ballot submission. We provided registration alternatives and advised to contact the local clerk to discuss specific accommodations. (SR# 2112730)

Additionally, DRM was contacted by a person with blindness who had not been able to use the accessible ballot in the May election. She was seeking assistance to ensure that she would be able to cast her vote in the future.  DRM staff drafted a reasonable accommodations request letter on her behalf to the Michigan Secretary of State and her election administrator requesting that her ballots be formatted so they could be read by JAWS 2020 for Windows and VoiceOver for the iPhone.  We also requested that she be provided with the opportunity to return her ballots electronically. The Michigan Secretary of State’s Office responded to the reasonable accommodations request, explaining that the formats for the accessible voter ballot application and ballot have changed and are now available through the Democracy Live OmniBallot, a platform compatible with the iPhone and other Mac devices. The Secretary of State’s Office also reiterated that Michigan law requires that a ballot be printed, placed in a signed envelope, and returned to the local clerk.  DRM researched the issue of private voting and determined the case was not suitable for a lawsuit. Staff communicated with the client an offer of assistance in securing other accommodations. The client related, however, that although she initially had a hard time obtaining the ballot, she had acquired one, voted on her computer, and had a friend assist in printing and dropping off the ballot, so she had been able to vote. (SR# 2090348) 

DRM Provides Informed Voter Training and Outreach to Adults with Disabilities

Dr. Schur’s research suggests that lack of information on candidates and issues is one of the primary reasons voters with disabilities turn out less often than the general voting public. Toward that end, DRM engaged in a number of outreach events designed to help voters with disabilities gain access to nonpartisan information. In Michigan, DRM participated in 10 training events reaching 230 people. Many of these events were conducted in conjunction with the Self-Advocates of Michigan and presented jointly with persons with disabilities. DRM also completed a high school curriculum and presented once to 60 students in a special education transition program in Detroit. 

DRM, Rooted in Rights, Block by Block Creative, and 14 other P&As financed, finalized and launched the “Vote for Access” Series. DRM invested funds and in-kind time contributions to complete the series. Episode 3 featured a Michigan resident with a case that was successfully resolved and a Michigan clerk providing voting information and unique training to staff. The first video launched on April 29, 2020 and each episode launched each week until the series was complete. The series was viewed over 500,000 times nationwide.


Finally, DRM developed and disseminated candidate questionnaires to all candidates for Federal offices in Michigan (President, U.S. Senate, and 14 U.S. House races). These questionnaires included questions developed by people with disabilities. DRM planned to publish the responses in races where both major candidates responded in October 2020.",,,,,
MI,2021,"In response to a request to assist in staffing the Michigan Legal Rapid Response Team, set up to answer questions and ensure legal rights were enforced during the November 2020 election, two DRM attorneys participated in answering questions, addressing concerns, and staffing an election day hotline. The work included voter protection activities such as staffing the call-in center (a Michigan hotline accepting calls about voting rights), including questions related to requiring voter ID, allowing voting when the voter did not receive an absentee ballot, and questions related to poll watchers and poll challengers.

DRM attorneys received training and a protocol was developed for routing election-related calls to select staff including the attorneys assigned to work on the election protection hotline on election day.

PAVA performance measure: 1,000,000 (number of registered voters in Michigan with disabilities, according to the School of Management and Labor Relations for Rutgers University).

DRM Advances Voting Rights
According to Dr. Lisa Schur and Douglas Kruse, professors at the School of Management and Labor Relations for Rutgers University, voter turnout surged among citizens with disabilities in 2020, as it did in 2018. Their turnout increased by 5.9 points relative to the 2016 general election, which was slightly more than the 5.3 point increase among citizens without disabilities. 795,000 people with disabilities in Michigan reported voting in the November 2020 elections. DRM engaged in a number of PAVA activities to encourage voters with disabilities to participate in the electoral process and guarantee their right to vote.  

DRM Handles Voting Concerns of Individuals

• A caller wanted to know if her employer had the right to require “proof” of voting if given time off to vote. We provided information from the Michigan voting website that employers are not required to grant leave time and encouraged her to contact her union or ask for what “proof” is acceptable. (SR#2120989)
• A mother (guardian) contacted us on behalf of her son through the “Request Help” form online. Guardian was told by county clerk’s office she could not use her guardianship paperwork to sign for her son’s vote. She wanted the clerk to provide legal documentation stating rule. We told her the clerk was correct but is still responsible for creating an acceptable response when her son votes (dot, checkmark, etc.). DRM advocate strongly encouraged early voting. (SR#2120730)
• A caller (voter engagement specialist) from a voter hotline called seeking information to assisting voters with disabilities on getting rides to the polls. We provided caller with a list of vendors providing free to low-cost rides to drop boxes or polls on election day. (SR#2117593)
• The resident of a psychiatric hospital called because they did not receive their absentee ballot after filling out an application. DRM advocate suggested resident call their local clerk’s office and provided clerks phone number via mail. (SR#2116485) 
• A caller requested information on state law/statue that allows her son with a DD Guardianship to vote after he received an application for a mail-in absentee ballot. We provided caller with citations from the U.S. federal laws that assure access to voting for individuals with disabilities. (SR#2115559)
• DRM was contacted by a caller who was unable to vote with the accessible voting machine, having to vote by paper ballot with no privacy. In addition to the inaccessible voting machine the caller was injured while existing the polling location. Client was ultimately able to retain an attorney for her personal injuries. DRM advocates continued to investigate the polling place accessibility. (SR#2124860)

PAVA performance measure: 6 individual clients assisted.

DRM Promotes Voter Registration and Engages in Online Outreach

DRM continued to leverage its high number of information and referral calls by including in is Client Satisfaction Survey an invitation to request voter registration information. In FY 2021 DRM sent out 28 voter registration packets as requested by eligible callers. (Project#98687)
PAVA performance measure: 28 (number of eligible clients who received voter registration information).

DRM engaged in extensive social media coverage on voting rights and voter engagement, reaching 8,120 through its nonpartisan information postings.

During FY20, DRM created an online Facebook group called “Voting with Disabilities in Michigan” (VDM). This group was a collaboration with the Bureau of Elections, the Brain Injury Association of Michigan, Michigan Disability Rights Coalition, Michigan Developmental Disabilities Council (DD Council), and Michigan State University Usability/Accessibility Research and Consulting. The group received 121 “likes” during FY21 and reached 2,130 people. The VDM group and Facebook page is still active. 

VDM conducted two voting webinars in collaboration with the DD Council. 
• October 5, 2020: 5 panel members who were individuals with disabilities, spoke on their personal experiences voting and why it’s important for people with disabilities to vote.
• October 7, 2020: 3 panel experts answered questions regarding voting rights. Two members of the DRM staff participated as panel experts.

The webinars reached a total of 1,176 individuals and 17 people combined joined the webinars as they were live. These webinars are still available to watch on the VDM Facebook page. (Project#105379)

During FY21 a total of 156 individuals visited the DRM “Voting Resources” page on the www.drmich.org website throughout FY21. 

PAVA performance measure: 1,193 (based on the number of individuals reached by webinars).

DRM Provides Resources to Adults with Disabilities

Dr. Lisa Schur and Douglas Kruse’s research suggests that in addition to difficulty voting, voter turnout is explained by lower levels of political recruitment and lower feelings of political efficacy. Toward that end, DRM created informational tools aimed at helping voter with disabilities gain access to nonpartisan information. 

In quarter 4 of FY20 DRM developed and disseminated candidate questionnaires to all candidates for federal offices in Michigan (President, U.S. Senate, and 14 U.S. House races). These questionnaires included questions developed by people with disabilities. DRM received complete responses from 5 House races and reported the answers on the agency Facebook page (reaching 122 people) and the agency website, impacting 710,000 people. (*Average congressional district size is 710,000 people (2010 US Census). Multiply by 5 districts. Divide by 5 (incidence of disability). (Project#104404)

PAVA performance measure: 31,164 (unique users recorded as interacting with the DRM website).

DRM co-sponsored the statewide Election Protection Program to provide a centralized, reliable source of election information to Michigan voters, including voters with disabilities. The Program website included FAQs on voter registration, voting at home, and access to voting on Election Day. The Program’s Rapid Response hotline handled over 7,000 calls in Q1. DRM staff helped draft and edit website content, participated in issue-related conference calls, and provided volunteer attorneys to staff the hotline. (Project#105379)

DRM participated in the Progress Michigan Public Education & Communications Work Group. The group met throughout the year, but increased meeting to once a week from October 1 – November 4 to discuss specific voting needs identified by partner advocacy groups on the call. Based on that information, the work group created 27 “hot topic” posts for dissemination throughout the partner social media channels. DRM is still an active member in this work group. (Project#105379)

DRM Collaborated with Election Officials on Training Tools and Voter Outreach

Throughout FY20 DRM participated in two statewide elections commissions on cybersecurity and election modernization. As a result of these commissions DRM has been able to build a rapport with members of the Michigan Secretary of State.

This year, DRM was invited to participate in the Michigan Secretary of State (SOS) Community Roundtable discussion with Jocelyn Benson. There were a total of 28 individuals on this virtual call including 5 from Secretary Benson’s office. The Secretary and her team discussed what the department is currently doing to make voting more accessible and the upcoming redistricting that Michigan is currently facing. During the meeting it was mentioned the department was creating a series of instructional videos for election workers. DRM reached out to SOS members on the call and offered to assist in the creation of those videos.

The SOS did reach out to DRM and asked for assistance in creating voting scrips for clerks and election workers. As a result of their request DRM drafted 10 scripts through a collaboration with clerks, election staff, advocacy partners, MSU, and voter assist terminal vendors (Election Source).  The SOS is still reviewing the scripts and is hopeful the vides will be done by the November 2021 election. (Project#105378)

Video Summary:
1. Voter Assist Terminal Vendors – 9 Scripts Total
• Dominion (3 scripts)
• ES&S (3 scripts)
• Hart (3 scripts)

Three scripts were created for each vendor with the following topics 
• Machine Overview
• At the Polling Place
• Voter Assistance

2. Assisting voters with disability at the polling place.
This script was created to provide clerks and election workers with an introduction to sensitivity training on election day.

DRM Participated in State-level Policy Work

According to the Brennan Center for Justice between January 1 and June 21, 17 states enacted 28 new laws that restrict access to the vote. In addition to potential legislation making it harder for individuals to vote, there is the potential undermine the voting process. 

DRM monitored meetings and recommendations from state legislative elections committees, co-wrote policy education letters to legislators, submitted written comments explaining the impact federal policy and state laws have on individuals with disabilities, and reviewed testimony on House Bill 5288 regarding the elimination of electronic signatures as the author claims this will have no impact on people with disabilities.

MI,2023,"In FY23, DRM focused on maximizing the impact of PAVA funding through collaborative and interdisciplinary outreach, education, and self-advocacy assistance. This strategy not only serves DRM clients directly, but also works to empower voters with disabilities, their communities, voting advocates, and disability service providers to advocate for more accessible voting at all stages of the process. Voters with disabilities experience inaccessible polling places, untrained election workers and unprepared Voter Assist Terminals (VAT), and the same pervasive stigma and lack of inclusion our constituents experience across many settings. Michigan’s election system is highly decentralized, administered at the municipal level, and problems are often specific to localities, requiring direct outreach. DRM is working with a diverse range of public and private partners to promote election worker education and polling place preparedness. DRM’s goals are to provide accurate and up to date information through outreach, trainings, consultation, and media development, so voters with disabilities, the people supporting them, and elections officials and administrators understand and uphold the rights and needs of Michigan’s diverse population of voters with disabilities. In this fiscal year, DRM especially worked to develop and expand coalitions of disability advocates and voting advocates, and further connect these communities. 

DRM engaged in outreach and consultation for local and state level elections officials across multiple projects in FY23. 

State Level Elections Officials:
In FY23, DRM worked to strengthen collaboration with Michigan Department of State (MDOS). In addition to collaborative outreach events with the Bureau of Elections (BOE), DRM was invited to meet with MDOS staff to discuss voting accessibility concerns and upcoming MDOS Election Policy Working Group. DRM has also renewed collaborative efforts to improve MDOS VAT training materials and provided consultations on media accessibility and training materials. MDOS has also expressed interest in promoting DRM’s Voters with Disabilities Storytelling project, in which a diverse range of Michigan voters with disabilities tell stories about voting and promote self-advocacy and voter empowerment, as well as drawing attention to barriers faced by voters with disabilities. 

Local Elections Officials:
DRM attended the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks (MAMC) annual conference in FY23 to promote DRM as a voting accessibility and training resource. DRM shared training and outreach materials with 364 local elections officials from across Michigan.

Key collaborative projects with local elections officials were providing polling place accessibility consultations and election worker training and recruitment support. State-level partner MDOS BOE refers local elections officials to DRM for consultations on polling place accessibility and ADA audits. 

Polling Place Accessibility:
In FY23, DRM received requests for accessibility consultation or assessment from three municipalities: City of Lansing, City of Battle Creek, and Harrison Township. In total, DRM polling place accessibility consultations helped to ensure accessibility for 25,746 voters with disabilities. 
DRM assisted Lansing in assessing 4 polling locations that serve 8 precincts. Based on DRM’s consultation, changes were made to layout and entrances/exits, improving accessibility for an estimated 2,267 Lansing voters with disabilities. 
Battle Creek and Harrison Township solicited feedback on the accessibility prospective early voting locations. Because these early voting locations will be available to all voters in these municipalities, DRM’s feedback helped to ensure accessibility for an estimated 23,479 Battle Creek and Harrison Township voters with disabilities. 

In FY23, DRM’s accessibility activities have been limited to those requested. However, DRM hopes to collaborate with Disability Network/Michigan (Michigan’s network of Centers for Independent Living), Michigan Statewide Independent Living Council, and Detroit Disability Power to implement a statewide election day accessibility auditing project in coming years.

Election Worker Training and Recruitment: 
In FY23, DRM worked to complete the election worker training video project, started in FY22. The training video featured a diverse group of voters with disabilities from across Michigan, speaking about their own experiences voting and best practice for election workers assisting voters with disabilities. The video was completed in FY23 Q3 and published to DRM’s YouTube channel. This video was also shared with project partner City Clerk of Lansing, as well as MDOS. MDOS has added the video to their training library and promoted it to local elections officials. This video was also sent via email to all MAMC attendees, reaching the 364 local elections officials that attended the conference. In FY23, DRM grew and strengthened coalitions that support the rights of voters with disabilities. These coalitions have helped to develop targeted outreach opportunities and collaborative educational projects, as well as maximizing impact of policy advocacy. 

DRM partners with Promote the Vote (PTV), a diverse, non-partisan voting advocacy organization working to preserve, enhance, and protect voting rights for all Michigan voters. In FY23, collaboration with PTV had three primary focus areas: accessibility consultations; policy consultations; and a collaborative project to develop accessible, multimedia revisions of PTV’s Know Your Rights voting guide. This guide is disseminated by PTV partners across the state and has significant reach and recognition but needs revisions to be accessible to various disability needs including low literacy and intellectually disabled voters. This project is ongoing and was further delayed by major changes in state election policy pending finalization. 

Number served: 18,580, number of individuals who visited the Promote the Vote website in FY23 (17,958), PTV Facebook followers (164), and Instagram followers (458).

In FY23 DRM consulted with PTV providing insights on inclusive practices, including media accessibility. This service was originally funded by a FY22 grant from PTV, but DRM continued to provide consultations at no cost in FY23, for the benefit of Michigan’s estimated 1,000,000 voters with disabilities. DRM also provided consultations to PTV policy advisors on potential impact of proposed election policy on voters with disabilities.

FY23 saw continuing work on the Know Your Rights guide project, for which PTV is contributing $30,000 of the total $45,000 costs, with the remainder funded by DRM PAVA funds. FY23 activities included a stakeholder planning meeting to include organizations serving a range of marginalized communities, including: Michigan Disability Rights Coalition; Michigan Developmental Disabilities Council; Michigan Developmental Disabilities Institute; Detroit Disability Power; Michigan Department of Civil Rights Division on Deaf, DeafBlind, and Hard of Hearing;  Southwest Detroit Community Development Corporation (Latino/Spanish speakers/immigrant voters); APIA Vote Michigan (Asian and Pacific Islander/Arabic speakers/immigrant voters), and; Voting Access for All (pre-adjudicated and returning criminal justice involved voters). DRM and PTV have worked with vendor, Kingsley-Kleimann, to develop and review draft materials and provide updates on policy changes. This project has been delayed by significant and ongoing election policy changes in FY23 and will continue into FY24. 

DRM also leads the Voting with Disabilities in Michigan (VDM) coalition, which helps to develop and advise on projects such as the election worker training video, voter storytelling videos, and Know Your Rights Guide. VDM partners also provide outreach opportunities and support for events such as the Walk a Mile in My Shoes Rally, Brain Injury Association of Michigan’s annual conference, and DRM’s Disability Accessibility Day at Jackson Field. VDM also reviews election policy and other developing issues that may impact our constituents. Working collaboratively allows DRM to reach a more diverse range of voters with disabilities with a broader range of educational opportunities and build advocacy power. VDM partners include: Michigan Department of State, Bureau of Elections; Michigan DD Council; Self-Advocates of Michigan; Michigan Disability Rights Coalition; Michigan Statewide Independent Living Council; Brain Injury Association of Michigan; National Federation of the Blind of Michigan, and; Detroit Disability Power. DRM is always working to expand this coalition to reflect the diversity of Michigan’s voters with disabilities, promote intersectional approaches to advocacy, and build connections between historically siloed disability communities. DRM aspires to establish VDM as the leading collective voice for voters with disabilities in Michigan, across geography, identities, and disabilities. 

The ACLU reports that more than 400 anti-voter bills have been introduced in recent years. ""Suppression efforts range from the seemingly unobstructive, like strict voter ID laws and cuts to early voting, to mass purges of voter rolls and systemic disenfranchisement. These measures disproportionately impact people of color, students, the elderly, and people with disabilities.""",,,,,
MN,2020,"In FY2020 MDLC completed monitoring visits through virtual means because of the Covid-19 pandemic and state-wide restrictions.  MDLC did not limit its monitoring activity in FY 2020 to any one type of facility or service. Instead, the 32 facilities visited covered residential and day programs that varied in size and were located across the state. These facilities included a variety of residential facilities that serve adults and children. No health, safety or rights issues were noted. PADD staff will continue to monitor such facilities in FY 2021and provide both individual and systems advocacy on these issues. 

For MDLC’s PAVA polling place monitoring activities in FY 2020, we conducted polling place surveys of 143 separate locations during Minnesota’s August 11, 2020 primary election. These polling place visits resulted in nearly 400 areas of accessibility concern that we, according to our protocol, informed the Secretary of State. We estimate that those areas of concern could negatively impact over 9800 voters with disabilities. We calculated this number by multiplying the number of polling place visits by the average number of eligible voters in the precincts (1500) and then multiplying that number by the estimated percentage of registered voters with disabilities (23%) and finally multiplying that number by 20% to account for those voters with disabilities who are blind, deaf or have physical impairments and therefore who may need assistance need assistance at the polling place. MDLC does not typically do polling surveys on the general election day due to the demands on polling place staff, however, in November 2019, we conducted 20 additional visits on the general election day as there were not many contested or statewide elections.  As in the past, DLC trains volunteers to help us to conduct monitoring visits. Overall MDLC conducted outreach events for our PADD, PAAT, PATBI and PAVA work.  The far majority of these events were conducted virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  We continued to focus on underserved or unserved populations in the determination of the location of these events. For our PADD work, we participated in 18 events that reached an estimated 1100 individuals and their family members. And 3 of those events were targeted at underserved or unserved populations of different racial 
groups. During our virtual PADD training and outreach events, we made our materials  (brochures, factsheets or other resources) electronically to all participants. 

For our PAAT work, we participated in 8 events that reached an estimated 300 individuals and their family members. One event, for staff at community-based non-profit organization, targeted diverse communities. During our PAAT training and outreach events, we made our materials (brochures, factsheets or other resources) electronically to all participants. 

For our PATBI work, we participated in 14 events that reached an estimated 2500 
individuals and their family members. Two events, one for staff at community-based non-profit organization and another at a local technical/community college, targeted diverse communities. During our PATBI training and outreach events, we made our materials  (brochures, factsheets or other resources) electronically to all participants. 

Lastly, for our PAVA work, we participated in 16 events that reached an 
estimated 250 individuals and their family members Two events, one for staff at community-based non-profit organization and another at a local technical/community college, targeted diverse communities. During our PAVA training and outreach events, we made our materials  (brochures, factsheets or other resources) electronically to all participants. 

We note that MDLC staff members provided materials and information for multiple areas of our services at the same outreach event so the number of people we reached listed above overlap significantly. For example, during some outreach or exhibitions, MDLC staff provided materials and information about our PAVA work and our PATBI work. The 
individuals we reached are included in the summaries for PAVA and PATBI. We 
commonly bring information about the broad range of MDLC services to these events. 
However, there are times where we do specific events for only one or two grants 
(e.g. only PAVA). In FY2020 MDLC completed monitoring visits through virtual means because of the Covid-19 pandemic and state-wide restrictions.  MDLC did not limit its monitoring activity in FY 2020 to any one type of facility or service.

PADD staff will continue to monitor such facilities in FY 2022 and provide both individual and systems advocacy on these issues. 

Also, in FY2021, MDLC began examining potential racial disparities in nursing homes.  MDLC conducted research into utilization rates by race and, during certain monitoring visits, inquired on racial differences in the population of nursing home residents. 

For MDLC’s PAVA polling place monitoring activities in FY 2021, we conducted polling place surveys of 134 separate locations during Minnesota’s November 3 11, 2020 general election.

We list a total of 147 visits (43 monitoring and 134 polling place). 

Please note that our performance measurements do not line up completely with the Goal and Priorities.  We have corrected that issue with revisions to the FY22 Goals and Priorities.  We can provide further explanation upon request. Activities for this Goal apply to PADD, PAAT, PATBI and PAVA. A forty-four-year-old Native American male?with a spinal cord injury, missing extremities,?and severe pressure wounds contacted?MDLC for assistance?securing a power standing?wheelchair to prevent neglect of care for the wounds and eliminate a potential of harm caused by transfers.  The?initial?request was made by our client?via Medical Assistance?through Medica, his managed care provider.?The nature of our client’s pressure wounds have required multiple surgeries and skin grafts.?Complications from burn injuries limit?where future skin grafts can be taken resulting in?the surgeons’ inability to repair his wounds. Our client?had been using a separate standing device as part of his therapy to prevent pressure wounds and the?prevention of contractures. However, due to?changes in his medical condition, his staff were no longer able to help him in and out of the separate standing device. The standing feature would replace the separate standing device and eliminate the need for staff to do an unsafe transfer into a separate standing device.?The standing feature would?also?aid in?relieving?pressure?and prevent?future?pressure wounds. Medica approved a new power wheelchair and multiple accessories but denied the standing feature and related equipment, seat elevator, and LED lighting package. MDLC represented?our client?at an administrative hearing and received a favorable decision for?all?the requested items.?? 

A fifty-nine-year-old African American male with a brain injury?who receives waivered services?filed an appeal after his request for additional waivered services was denied. The client reported a gradual reduction in services over several years?which resulted in him not receiving necessary help with homemaking tasks and his basic living needs were being neglected.?The client also reports a reduction in mobility which hinders his ability to complete daily living tasks.?MDLC advocated for the client to receive additional supports to?fulfill neglected needs?with cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping and other related homemaking tasks.?The case manager authorized additional hours of homemaking per week. The client accepted the offer and canceled the appeal hearing.?? 

A fifty-nine-year-old group home resident with?a?brain injury had adverse reactions?to medications, causing significant?gait issues and?fall risks. His adult foster care provider did not think it could address?his needs?adequately and moved to demit him due to safety concerns?and the?sites’?inability to keep him safe.?The client's gait problems and fall risks were resolved prior to appeal hearing. However, the?provider argued his behaviors had worsened and?they?still intended to demit him based on behavioral concerns.??MDLC?argued that the reasons for the initial demission notice were no longer?current,?and the provider did not adequately address the behaviors or issue a new demission notice related to behaviors.?During the hearing the?Judge?ruled?in client's favor and ordered the provider to reverse its demission notice.?


PADD staff continues to participate on a state legislatively created work group?administered by the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) and is charged with addressing the use of physical holds/restraints and seclusion on students with developmental disabilities. The group continues to examine data on restrictive procedure use and?discussing strategies to eliminate seclusion and reduce the use of restraints.?The work in this group significantly?changed?in?nature?due?to?the?Covid 19?related?closure?of?schools?as?well?as?the?death?of George Floyd and the resulting social unrest.??In FY2021,?MDLC advocated for more attention to be paid to the racial dynamics of mostly white staff restraining/secluding mostly non-white students as well as the?roles of school resource officers in the school environment. The Workgroup reviewed and reported the number of schools using PBIS prevention measures and school’s quarterly holding data. It reported that COVID-19 and the prevalence of distance learning reduced the occurrences of physical holds overall. MDLC staff also participated in the restrictive procedure research and review subgroup. The subgroup’s task was to collect, compile and consider relevant information from academic or public agency sources for the Workgroup to consider with Action 1 pertaining to the presence of SROs related to the use of restrictive procedures. MDLC’s advocacy, in conjunction with the ???advocacy of other groups, resulted in MDE addressing these issues in smaller workgroups, developing ??? strategies to assist students and staff, and revising its annual report to include these issues.?We estimate that of the approximately 3500 students who experienced restraint or seclusion, 1200 of them have an I/DD or TBI. 

Policy work that focuses on abuse and neglect issues include our participation on task forces/working groups, including: the 1. statewide network of the Working Interdisciplinary Network of Guardianship Stakeholders (focusing on training and less restrictive guardianship/conservatorship options), 2. Students not Suspensions (alternatives to K-12 school suspensions/discipline), and, for example, 4. The state’s Restrictive Procedures Task Force (reducing restraint and seclusion in K-12 public schools).  Also, we believe that our participation on work groups relating to the overall of the waiver system works to prevent abuse and neglect as well as access to needed health care. 

Our individual case advocacy is supported by and informs our work with monitoring, outreach/presentations, educating policy makers, systemic litigation, collaborations, and other systemic activities.  Those related efforts are described further in the respective sections of this report.  We list 1200 people as a conservative estimate of those impacted by our work to reduce abuse and neglect.

Policy Work: For the past four years, Minnesota has been working on a multi-phase overhaul of the state’s home and community-based waiver programs. PADD staff have devoted significant time at each step to ensure that the interests of PADD-eligible clients are well understood and incorporated in the changes being implemented and planned. Previously, the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) submitted waiver amendments consolidating and creating new waiver services with the goals of simplifying and unifying waiver services and service options across all waivers. In FY21, PADD staff continued to follow up with conversations with DHS staff aimed at preserving client service options and rights. As before, these communications led directly to modifications and clarifications in the proposed amendments that better identified and incorporated client choice and continuity of care and services as basic program principles. This systemic advocacy is ongoing and expected to continue over the next two-plus years as Minnesota seeks to consolidate its four disability waivers into two and to develop a universal, individualized service budgeting process.  Other policy work involves DLC staff participation on task forces/working groups, including: the 1. statewide network of the Working Interdisciplinary Network of Guardianship Stakeholders (focusing on training and less restrictive guardianship/conservatorship options), 2. Assistive Living Work Group (AL licensing changes and other issues), 3. Students not Suspensions (alternatives to K-12 school suspensions/discipline), 4. state’s Restrictive Procedures Task Force (reducing restraint and seclusion in K-12 public schools), 5. Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Interventions (increase awareness and effectiveness of this state health care option), 6. Minnesota Department of Health Advisory Committee, and 7. Minnesota Autism Council.  On these task forces/working groups, DLC staff work to identify issues, recommendations and strategies to promote independent living and decrease discrimination.   

Our individual case advocacy is supported by and informs our work with monitoring, outreach/presentations, educating policy makers, systemic litigation, collaborations, and other systemic activities.  Those related efforts are described further in the respective sections of this report. Conservatively, we estimate these collective efforts advanced the rights of more than 30,000 people.  That estimate is based on a subset of the number of people with I/DD who receive waivered services from the State plus other people with TBI and users of Assistive Technology who are likely to benefit from these efforts. 

Please note that our performance measurements do not line up completely with the Goal and Priorities.  We have corrected that issue with revisions to the FY22 Goals and Priorities.  We can provide further explanation upon request. Activities for this Goal apply to PADD, PAAT, PATBI and PAVA. MDLC conducted 58 total training/presentation and outreach events for our PADD, PAAT, PATBI and PAVA work, reaching approximately 8500 individuals. The far majority of these events were conducted virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We continued to focus on underserved or unserved populations in the determination of the location of these events and participated in 14 events with this focus.  

More specifically, during our virtual PADD training and outreach events, we participated in 48 events that reached an estimated 8000 individuals and their family members. Ten events (including ones to parents of special education students, a Sudanese group, and to attendees of a Minneapolis event) targeted diverse communities. During our PADD training and outreach events, we made our materials (brochures, factsheets or other resources) electronically or in person to all participants. 

For our PAAT work, we participated in 17 events that reached an estimated 1300 individuals and their   family members. Five events (including ones to rural communities, diverse law student population and local libraries in metro areas) targeted diverse communities. During our PAAT training and outreach events, we made our materials (brochures, factsheets or other resources) electronically or in person to all participants. 

For our PATBI work, we participated in 33 events that reached an estimated 6000 

individuals and their family members. Ten events (including ones to a Somali group and a local YMCA) targeted diverse communities. During our PATBI training and outreach events, we made our materials (brochures, factsheets or other resources) electronically or in person to all participants. 

Lastly, for our PAVA work, we participated in 39 events that reached an estimated 7000 individuals and their family members. Ten events (including ones to tribal communities and high school transition age students) targeted diverse communities. During our PAVA training and outreach events, we made our materials (brochures, factsheets or other resources) electronically to all participants. 

We note that MDLC staff members provided materials and information for multiple areas of our services at the same outreach event so the number of people we reached listed above overlap significantly. For example, during some outreach or exhibitions, MDLC staff provided materials and information about our PAVA work and our PATBI work. The individuals we reached are included in both the summaries for PAVA and PATBI. We commonly bring information about the broad range of MDLC services to these events. However, there are times where we do specific events for only one or two grants (e.g. only PAVA or only PATBI and PAVA).   

We also note that estimated total of 8500 attendees includes the estimated total of 2500 attendees listed below in Goal 4, Priority 2.  

MDLC also maintained eight factsheets on Covid-19 rights related issues.  These are located on lawhelpmn.org.

Policy Work: For the past four years, Minnesota has been working on a multi-phase overhaul of the state’s home and community-based waiver programs. PADD staff have devoted significant time at each step to ensure that the interests of PADD-eligible clients are well understood and incorporated in the changes being implemented and planned. Previously, the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) submitted waiver amendments consolidating and creating new waiver services with the goals of simplifying and unifying waiver services and service options across all waivers. In FY21, PADD staff continued to follow up with conversations with DHS staff aimed at preserving client service options and rights. As before, these communications led directly to modifications and clarifications in the proposed amendments that better identified and incorporated client choice and continuity of care and services as basic program principles. This systemic advocacy is ongoing and expected to continue over the next two-plus years as Minnesota seeks to consolidate its four disability waivers into two and to develop a universal, individualized service budgeting process.  Other policy work involves DLC staff participation on task forces/working groups, including: the 1. statewide network of the Working Interdisciplinary Network of Guardianship Stakeholders (focusing on training and less restrictive guardianship/conservatorship options), 2. Assistive Living Work Group (AL licensing changes and other issues), 3. Students not Suspensions (alternatives to K-12 school suspensions/discipline), 4. state’s Restrictive Procedures Task Force (reducing restraint and seclusion in K-12 public schools), 5. Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Interventions (increase awareness and effectiveness of this state health care option), 6. Minnesota Department of Health Advisory Committee, and 7. Minnesota Autism Council.  On these task forces/working groups, DLC staff work to identify issues, recommendations and strategies to promote independent living and decrease discrimination.   

Our individual case advocacy is supported by and informs our work with monitoring, outreach/presentations, educating policy makers, systemic litigation, collaborations, and other systemic activities.  Those related efforts are described further in the respective sections of this report. Conservatively, we estimate these collective efforts advanced the rights of more than 30,000 people.  That estimate is based on a subset of the number of people with I/DD who receive waivered services from the State plus other people with TBI and users of Assistive Technology who are likely to benefit from these efforts. 

Please note that our performance measurements do not line up completely with the Goal and Priorities.  We have corrected that issue with revisions to the FY22 Goals and Priorities.  We can provide further explanation upon request. Activities for this Goal apply to PADD, PAAT, PATBI and PAVA. A 47-year-old?female with a brain injury lives in a customized living setting where staff are present 24 hours a day seven days a week. The client has 4 hours each day of independence time in the community. The client requested alone time in her apartment. MDLC advocated for the client to have alone time during the day and discontinuation of overnight supervision. After several conversations with the case manager and the client’s guardian the service provider agreed and implemented the changes. Our client reports that the changes are in place and that she is pleased with the outcome.

MDLC continues to successfully litigate Murphy v. Harpstead, a certified class action against the state of Minnesota regarding their treatment of individuals with disabilities who are unnecessarily segregated in corporate foster care facilities. The class consists of at least 800 people, 200 of whom are PAIR eligible clients. At the close of FY19, a U.S. Federal District Court granted Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgement, declared that the policies and practices of the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) are violating their constitutionally protected due process rights, and denying Defendant’s Motion to Summary Judgment.  

Due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, discovery was reopened in the matter to gather facts regarding activities that have occurred since the close of the original discovery period in 2018.During FY21, the parties engaged in significant written discovery involving the production of hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, and motion practice related to those issues. Depositions and supplemental expert reports will occur in the first have of FY22, with a trial date set for May 2022. 

The Plaintiffs’ goal remains for the state or the state to put a system in place that allows individuals with disabilities to live where they want, like everyone else, and in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. MDLC has enlisted two private law firms to co-counsel with the P&A on this class action pro bono.  

During FY2021 MDLC collaborated with the National Federation for the Blind to advocate for absentee ballots to have accessible formats. MDLC demanded the Minnesota Secretary of State ensure accessibility and threatened legal action. The ballots were made accessible in FY2021 and in time for the 2020 general election.  This was a significant advancement in ensuring individuals with print disabilities were able to exercise their right to vote. 

Our individual case advocacy is supported by and informs our work with monitoring, outreach/presentations, educating policy makers, systemic litigation, collaborations, and other systemic activities.  Those related efforts are described further in the respective sections of this report. 

Please note that our performance measurements do not line up completely with the Goal and Priorities.  We have corrected that issue with revisions to the FY22 Goals and Priorities.  We can provide further explanation upon request. Activities for this Goal apply to PADD, PAAT, PATBI and PAVA. In FY 21, MDLC filed a class action lawsuit against the state of Minnesota that challenges the state’s special education age-out definition. Currently Minnesota law ends special education eligible for transition-age students on July 1 of the year in which a student turns 21.  MDLC asserts that this law is contrary to federal law which permits eligibility through age 21 and denies transition age students up to a year of critical transition services that would help them obtain transition services, employment supports, and opportunities for competitive integrated employment. We estimate that over 3000 students with I/DD and TBI would benefit from this lawsuit. 

MDLC staff assisted a 19-year-old student who was receiving special education transition age services from the school district.  Due to the Covid-19 restrictions, the student was not able to receive in-person services and remote or virtual services were not helpful due to the student’s disabilities.  As the pandemic restrictions eased, MDLC staff worked with the parents and the student in reviewing records and determining the level of services that would benefit the students.  MDLC attended a conciliation conference and successfully negotiated a return-to-in-person services plan consisting of 4 days a week of in-school, in person services.  These services include transition age services that can assist the student in employment supports and options. 

Please note that our performance measurements do not line up completely with the Goal and Priorities.  We have corrected that issue with revisions to the FY22 Goals and Priorities.  We can provide further explanation upon request. Activities for this Goal apply to PADD, PAAT, PATBI and PAVA. PADD staff continues to participate on a state legislatively created work group?administered by the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) and is charged with addressing the use of physical holds/restraints and seclusion on students with developmental disabilities. The group continues to examine data on restrictive procedure use and?discussing strategies to eliminate seclusion and reduce the use of restraints.?The work in this group significantly?changed?in?nature?due?to?the?Covid 19?related?closure?of?schools?as?well?as?the?death?of George Floyd and the resulting social unrest.??In FY2021,?MDLC advocated for more attention to be paid to the racial dynamics of mostly white staff restraining/secluding mostly non-white students as well as the?roles of school resource officers in the school environment. The Workgroup reviewed and reported the number of schools using PBIS prevention measures and school’s quarterly holding data. It reported that COVID-19 and the prevalence of distance learning reduced the occurrences of physical holds overall. MDLC staff also participated in the restrictive procedure research and review subgroup. The subgroup’s task was to collect, compile and consider relevant information from academic or public agency sources for the Workgroup to consider with Action 1 pertaining to the presence of SROs related to the use of restrictive procedures. MDLC’s advocacy, in conjunction with the ???advocacy of other groups, resulted in MDE addressing these issues in smaller workgroups, developing ??? strategies to assist students and staff, and revising its annual report to include these issues.?We estimate that of the approximately 3500 students who experienced restraint or seclusion, 1200 of them have an I/DD or TBI. 

MDLC also participated on a task force (Solutions not Suspensions) to address Pre-K-12 student discipline issues and educated policy makers about the urgent need for the State and school districts to create an entitlement for “Recovery Services” for students with disabilities who were negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic limitations on special education services.

We can provide further explanation upon request. Activities for this Goal apply to PADD, PAAT, PATBI and PAVA. DLC assisted a 10-year-old student with Cerebral Palsy and a significantly compromised immune system.  The student was not able to access in person school services during Covid. ?School kept on reducing virtual and in-person services despite the student’s obvious need. ?MDLC investigated, obtained records, consulted with parent and intervened with district by negotiating with the school’s attorney, attending an IEP team meeting, and threatening legal action.  District responded by offering some additional services, but not enough. ?MDLC helped parent file an administrative complaint with the Minnesota Department of Education.  MDE agreed with the parent’s position and ordered the district to provide compensatory education services for the student and otherwise address other legal violations. 

MDLC participated on a task force (Solutions not Suspensions) to address Pre-K-12 student discipline issues, on a Restrictive Procedures work group (described above) and educated policy makers about the urgent need for the State and school districts to create an entitlement for “Recovery Services” for students with disabilities who were negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic limitations on special education services.

Topics included: special education during the pandemic, working with VRS, sp ed and vocational rehabilitation services, civil rights of youth, work incentives, reasonable accommodations, voting rights for age-eligible youth, waiver employment services, and MDLC services.   Five of the 26 events that focused on populations of color.  We estimate that these events reached over 2500 youth, families, and providers. 

We note that the estimated total of 2500 attendees here is included in and not additional to the 8500 attendees listed above in Goal 4, Priority 1. 

MDLC also maintained factsheets on Covid-19 special education rights related issue.  This is located on lawhelpmn.org.

MN,2023,"In FY2023 MDLC completed fourteen monitoring visits through in-person means. MDLC did not limit its monitoring activity in FY 2023 to any one type of facility or service. Instead, the facilities visited covered residential and day programs that varied in size and were located across the state. These facilities included a variety of residential facilities that serve adults and children. No health, safety or rights issues were noted. PADD staff will continue to monitor such facilities in FY 2024 and provide both individual and systems advocacy on these issues.

For MDLC’s PAVA polling place monitoring activities in FY 2023, we conducted polling place surveys of 129 separate locations during Minnesota’s November 8, 2022, general election. These polling place visits resulted in many areas of accessibility concern that we, according to our protocol, informed the Secretary of State. We estimate that those areas of concern could negatively impact over 8,900 voters with disabilities. We calculated this number by multiplying the number of polling place visits by the average number of eligible voters in the precincts (1500) and then multiplying that number by the estimated percentage of registered voters with disabilities (23%) and finally multiplying that number by 20% to account for those voters with disabilities who are blind, deaf or have physical impairments and therefore who may need assistance need assistance at the polling place. As in the past, DLC trains volunteers to help us to conduct monitoring visits. 

We list a total of 86 visits (66 monitoring and 129 polling place). MDLC conducted 71 total training/presentation and outreach events for our PADD, PAAT, PATBI and PAVA work, reaching approximately 9,100 individuals. We are back to having the majority of these events/presentations in person. We continued to focus on underserved or unserved populations in the determination of the location of these events and participated in 17 events with this focus. 

We note that MDLC staff members provided materials and information for multiple areas of our services at the same outreach event so the number of people we reached listed above overlaps significantly. For example, during some outreach or exhibitions, MDLC staff provided materials and information about our PAVA work and our PATBI work. The individuals we reached are included in both the summaries for PAVA and PATBI. We commonly bring information about the broad range of MDLC services to these events. However, there are times where we do specific events for only one or two grants (e.g. only PAVA or only PATBI and PAVA).

MDLC assigned two outreach specialists to reach diverse and underserved groups. Some of the outreach opportunities we had in FY2023 included the Multicultural Autism Action Network (MAAN), the Southern Metro Muslim Leadership Summit, the Minnesota American Indian Bar Association, the Somali Diaspora Conference, the Somali Parents Autism Network, and the Muslim American Society.",,,,,

PAVA Annual Report
Fiscal Year 2021
October 1, 2020, through September 30, 2021

AREA ONE: To ensure full participation in the electoral process for individuals with disabilities.  Activities may include, but are not limited to, registering to vote, casting a vote, and accessing polling places:

In the weeks leading up to the November 2020 General Election, Mo P&A attorneys received reports that election authorities for Saint Louis County and Kansas City planned to limit curbside voting to select locations for in-person voting on Election Day.  Saint Louis County also planned to eliminate curbside voting for in-person absentee voting before Election Day.  Mo P&A partnered with the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition to demand that the two election authorities make curbside voting available to absentee and Election Day voters at all polling places.  On October 29, 2020, Saint Louis County agreed to offer curbside voting at all satellite locations for absentee voting.  The following day, Kansas City agreed to offer curbside voting at all polling places in compliance with state and federal law.  The expanded voting access for thousands of voters with disabilities in the two largest jurisdictions in the state.

Less than one week before Election Day 2020, a Kansas City voter with a disability requested assistance from Mo P&A to determine the status of her request for an absentee ballot.  After learning that the election authority had not received the voter’s request, Mo P&A and the voter discussed additional options for her to complete her ballot.  Mo P&A connected the voter with The Whole Person, which assisted her with transportation to the polling place on Election Day.  

Similar to the Kansas City voter, a voter in Butler County was unable to submit a request for inclusion on the “permanently disabled” list before the applicable deadline.  Mo P&A ensured that the election authority received his request for subsequent elections and relayed information on in-person absentee voting options to the voter.  

After Election Day, Mo P&A confirmed that the voters in Kansas City and Butler County successfully completed their ballots in person.  

“Area Two” details Mo P&A’s efforts with the Election Protection hotline.


AREA TWO:   To provide education, training, and assistance to individuals with disabilities that will promote their participation in the electoral process.  Activities may include, but are not limited to education regarding voter registration, providing individuals with disabilities information regarding their legal rights that pertain to voting, and providing assistance to individuals with disabilities in accessing the polls on Election Day:

Several Mo P&A attorneys joined the Litigation/Legal Rapid Response team for the Election Protection hotline on Election Day, November 3, 2020.  Attorneys fielded calls from voters across the state and provided technical assistance to resolve access issues in Saint Charles County and Kansas City.  This was the first time that Election Protection operated remotely without a central command center.  Attorneys received training on Our Vote Live to “take tickets” for callers with voting access complaints.  

From February through July 2021, Mo P&A collaborated with People First of Saint Joseph to develop a voter education presentation for self-advocates, as part of the Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered (“SABE”) Go Voter Project.  During three Zoom sessions on August 19, 24 and 25, Mo P&A and People First of Saint Joseph presented to around 20 self-advocates and direct service providers from across the state, on topics including voter registration, accessible voting options, and learning about candidates and issues.  People First of Saint Joseph received a small stipend for its completion of the Go Voter program.

From March through September 2021, Mo P&A assisted National Federation of the Blind of Missouri (“NFB”) in drafting a complaint regarding the lack of accessible voting options at polling places across the state.  NFB submitted the complaint to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) on September 30, 2021.  The preparation of the 11-page complaint consisted of two meetings with DOJ attorneys and several drafts circulated among blind voters who had experienced barriers to casting independent and secret ballots in the past.  Mo P&A assisted NFB in editing the narratives provided by dozens of voters and confirmed receipt of the complaint by DOJ.  As of September 30, 2021, DOJ had not responded to the complaint. 

After receiving a request in August 2021, Mo P&A distributed over 50 additional Vote at Home brochures to Delta Center for Independent Living in Saint Charles County.

From July through September 2021, Mo P&A contacted several centers for independent living and other service providers, including Paraquad, The Whole Person, and Arc of Saint Louis, to assess the need for ballot assistance for voters with disabilities and the impact of restrictions placed on ballot assistance by state law.  This outreach should lay a foundation for Mo P&A’s future initiative to improve access to ballot assistance for voters with disabilities.

As of September 30, 2021, Mo P&A, the Missouri Developmental Disabilities Council, and the UMKC Institute for Human Development were partnering to develop a statewide voter education program for 2022.  This program will also include direct support for voters who require assistance registering to vote, locating transportation on Election Day, and/or completing their ballots. 


AREA THREE:   Participate in advocacy and education efforts revolving around HAVA implementation efforts in their State or Territory.  Activities may include, but are not limited to participation on HAVA State Planning Committee, subcommittee or coalition efforts regarding the State Plan, and review, advocacy, and education concerning the enactment of HAVA State Legislation.

As a part of the outreach and education noted in “Area Two,” Mo P&A educated a large number of voters with disabilities on the enactment of HAVA and the means to access its complaint process.  

As part of the case noted in “Area Two,” Mo P&A advised the National Federation of the Blind of Missouri (“NFB”) on HAVA requirements and the nature of the HAVA complaint process.  NFB ultimately chose to submit its complaint to the U.S. Department of Justice rather than through the Secretary of State’s HAVA complaint portal.

Mo P&A also discussed the availability of electronic voting systems in accordance with HAVA during interactions with election authorities described in “Area Four.”


AREA FOUR: Training and education of election officials, poll workers, and election volunteers regarding the rights of voters with disabilities and best practices in working with individuals with disabilities.  Activities may include, but are not limited to providing training, and participating in the development of training education programs for election officials and poll workers.

From June through September 2021, Mo P&A partnered with the Missouri Developmental Disabilities Council (“DD Council”) to engage with election authorities and educate them regarding common barriers that affect the rights of voters with disabilities.  Mo P&A and the DD Council discussed key accessibility concerns with election authorities from Greene and Boone Counties on June 14, 2021.  The concerns included the tendency of poll workers to inappropriately “gatekeep” when responding to accommodation requests from voters with disabilities.  

As a result of the meeting, Mo P&A and the DD Council began developing a short presentation on “Accessible Voting for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities” for a wider audience of election authorities.  On September 9, 2021, Mo P&A and the DD Council made its presentation to dozens of election authorities at the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities Annual Conference.  Mo P&A also received survey results from about 10 election authorities on their perception of voting access issues in their jurisdictions.  Several election authorities indicated an interest in collaborating with Mo P&A to improve access for voters with disabilities.


AREA FIVE: To assist individuals with disabilities in filing complaints under the State-Based administrative grievance procedure required by HAVA and represent individuals in any hearing that may be held regarding the compliant.

During the cases noted in “Area Two,” Mo P&A continued to educate individuals with disabilities and service providers about the HAVA Elections Complaint Form and the procedure for filing a complaint.  Mo P&A monitored client calls and applications to identify potential systemic issues involving HAVA.  


AREA SIX: To provide assistance to States and other Governmental entities regarding the physical accessibility of polling places.   Activities may include, but are not limited to surveying polling places, identifying potential modifications to make specific polling places accessible, and developing criteria for identifying polling places:

From February through March 2021, Mo P&A assisted the Saint Louis City Board of the Election Commissioners (“the Board”) in developing a survey instrument to evaluate its polling places for compliance with the physical accessibility requirements of the ADA.  Because the survey instrument was a component of a Settlement Agreement between the Board and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), Mo P&A responded to edits suggested by DOJ to develop a final 30-page survey instrument in June 2021 for the Board to use in evaluating over 100 polling places.  Mo P&A also tested versions of the survey instrument at five polling places in Saint Louis City from March through July 2021 and shared the results with the Board.

In August 2021, Mo P&A contacted the Nodaway County Clerk’s Office regarding its request for signage informing voters of curbside voting options at polling places.  Mo P&A provided the clerk with an electronic version of the curbside voting sign developed by Mo P&A in 2018 so that the clerk’s office could print and distribute to all of its 19 polling places.


AREA SEVEN: To obtain training and technical assistance on voting issues, including education 
regarding accessible voting equipment and systems.  Once educated, the information may be used to inform others of the availability of accessible voting equipment and its use.

Throughout late 2020 and 2021, Mo P&A participated in weekly Zoom meetings for the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition to learn about a broad range of concerns affecting voting access and to collaborate with stakeholders to address those concerns.  By participating in the meetings, Mo P&A was able to follow developments in proposed legislation for photo ID requirements at the polls, which would have disproportionately impacted voters with disabilities.  This provided Mo P&A with valuable insights when conducting the outreach noted in the previous areas.

Mo P&A attended continuing education sessions related to voting access at the NDRN Annual Conference on May 21 and 25, 2021.  Topics included voting litigation opportunities for people with disabilities and data from 2020 on the voting experience for people with disabilities.

As part of the partnership noted in “Area Six,” Mo P&A and the Saint Louis City Board of Election Commissioners attended training sessions arranged by DOJ and conducted by an ADA architect on August 24 and 25, 2021.  After one day in a classroom setting and another day of field training, Mo P&A gained all of the knowledge and skills necessary to properly measure the accessibility of polling places.",,,,,
MO,2023,"See PAVA Report Mo P&A has historically provided PATBI, PAAT, and PAVA individual advocacy, legal, and investigation services on a first-come first-served basis. The PADD program has an  established annual Statement of Goals and Priorities designating the focus of PADD casework-related services.

A comprehensive PADD Statement of Goals & Priorities document is distributed via 8½ x 11 inch paper, accompanied by a one-page questionnaire, and a prepaid business reply envelope. In FY 2023 Mo P&A also used a website-based electronic questionnaire to solicit additional public comment. The information is presented annually to the Board of Directors for data driven analytical consideration for addressing any potential changes to the PADD SGP. 

Mo P&A practices provide for the publication of the proposed PADD Statement of Goals and Objectives (SGO) and distribution of the proposed PADD SGO. Mo P&A publishes the SGO on its website with a survey to solicit electronic input from the public. A banner directs the public to review and provide input when first visiting the website and this allows individuals to directly and continuously submit comments via the website and receive acknowledgement of their comments. Additionally, Mo P&A solicits input from other interested persons, service providers, and individuals with which Mo P&A staff come into contact via various outreach events, conferences, presentations, and through service on advisory groups, councils and committees. Mo P&A procedures allow individuals to provide comment at any time in person and/or in writing to the main office building. Mo P&A's practice is to provide mailed surveys to individuals served during past three program years. Website survey: https://form.jotform.com/231036959844061",,,,,
MS,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic greatly impacted all areas of the agency’s operations in 2020, including that of the PADD, PATBI, PAVA, and PAAT programs. Between the temporary closure of the DRMS office, the transition to teleworking, and restricted access for visitations at facilities, the DRMS team faced unprecedented challenges to their operations. Outreach, visits, and any meetings with officials, legislators, potential clients and other interested parties were unable to occur due to safety concerns. However, the team work diligently to respond to the crisis, quickly adapting to work efficiently in spite of the circumstances and continue to provide needed services as able. While the agency hopes to soon resume more typical operations, including outreach and meetings, DRMS is dedicated to continuing to coordinate and adapt its operations with respect to COVID-19 into FY 2021 and will continue to evolve as needed in order to serve Mississippians with disabilities. 

DRMS has restructured as an organization, creating new agency teams and adding new staff members. DRMS is now fully staffed and looks forward to utilizing the team to provide service and innovate in order to best serve people with disabilities who have faced rights violations. 

In spite of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency continued to serve clients as well as advocate for the rights of Mississippians with disabilities on the systemic level through litigation and projects. 

DRMS is working with Mississippi's Institutes for Higher Learning to conduct site accessibility surveys at major diversity athletic facilities across the state; this project was paused due to COVID-19 but will continue in FY 21. DRMS is also collaborating with the Mississippi Access to Justice Commission to conduct site accessibility surveys for courthouses across the state to ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to our justice system. Additionally, DRMS is conducting a sidewalk accessibility survey of sidewalks in the major metropolitan areas across the state; again, this project was delayed during FY20 due to COVID, but will resume and be completed in FY 21. 

Through PADD, DRMS has pursued litigation against Barnyard Kids Child Care Center for negligence and abuse; the litigation is in its final stages. The agency is awaiting a hearing on a Motion for Summary of Judgement, but no matter the outcome of that hearing, we will still have pending issues that will either go to trial or settle. 

As a result of resolved litigation against JATRAN, DRMS will continue to partner with the Department of Justice to oversee the consent degree requirements placed on the City of Jackson public transit system. 

Although delayed due to COVID safety restrictions, DRMS continues to conduct its prison monitoring, including visits with expert consultants to help identify issues of accessibility, conditions, medical care, and mental health care. Investigations are ongoing.",,,,,

ND,2021,"P&A worked in concert with the ND Secretary of State's Office, the ND Assoc. for the Blind, and other disability-related groups to change the absentee voting process for individuals who are blind or with visual impairments.  This issue came to light during the July 2020 primary election, when COVID-19 caused the closure of most voting precincts in ND and paper absentee ballots became the option for most citizens.  P&A advocated for individuals with disabilities to have an alternative option, to schedule appointments with county auditors to go to the county location for to use the Express Vote machine.  Unfortunately, this was not an effective solution for individuals who are blind or with visual impairments that did not have transportation.   Through direct collaboration, prior to and during the 2021 Legislative Session, a section of HB 1253 was written to address a change in ND law and the absentee voting process through the following language:  
       
Any voter who is blind, visually impaired, or print disabled qualified elector living with a disability that prevents the elector from reading or marking the ballot without assistance and who wishes to cast an absentee ballot may mark the electronic ballot by electronic means. The voter then shall deposit the ballot electronically on the secure server that is used by covered voters as defined in section 16.1 - 07 - 18. Upon system notification that a ballot has been left by a qualified voter, an election official shall print the ballot, place the ballot in a secrecy envelope, attach the absent voter's application for the ballot, and securely store the enveloped ballot and the application with all the other absentee ballots. When the absentee ballot election board meets to process and count absentee ballots, the ballot from the covered voter must be transferred onto a paper ballot and tabulated with all the other valid absent voters' ballots.

This process is the same as the one being used by military members serving out-of-the-country.  P&A's PAVA Coordinator testified in support of this section of the bill along with a retired P&A Advocate who is legally blind.  HB 1253 passed both Houses and was signed by the Governor. Prior to the primary election in July of 2020, P&A produced a YouTube video demonstrating how to use the Express Vote, an accessible voting machine.  It is shared through P&A's website at: https://www.ndpanda.org/resources/publications-and-videos.  During FY 2021, there were more than 600 views.

Prior to the general election, a mailing was sent out to a total of 14,574 individuals with disabilities and related stakeholders.  The packet included a cover letter and several PAVA produced items: a voting bookmark with information about using the Express Vote and voting by mail; a pocket guide with information about accessible voting options, identification requirements, etc.; and voting stickers.  Recipients included long-term care facility residents (9,137), self-advocates (114), recovery centers (175), individuals with disabilities supported by I/DD providers (2,146), Vocational Rehabilitation clients (2,215), advocacy organizations (16), community living services (216), mental health providers (160), Human Service Centers (200), and others (155).  

PAVA contributed voting items to youth with disabilities who participated in a ""Embrace Your Disability"" conference in FY 2021.  A total of 200 different voting pieces (red ""vote"" pens and ""vote"" flag sticky note pads) were distributed.  

Prior to the general election, PAVA had custom-made ""vote"" masks sewn and distributed to 500 individuals of disability-related groups including the State Council on Developmental Disabilities, I/DD and other service providers, and self-advocacy groups for people with disabilities, etc.  The goal was to encourage voting and to provide protection from the pandemic for those who chose to go to the polls.  A significant number of recipients expressed gratitude for the masks they received.

P&A’s website had a dedicated page called VOTE ND for the 2020 election.  It contained information on where and how to vote as well as ID requirements.  It also had information on accessible voting, including a link to P&A’s YouTube video on how to use Express Vote.  Links to the Secretary of State’s election website were also included.  For FY 2021, the page views for VOTE ND were approximately 374. In ND, P&A partners with the ND Secretary of State elections division staff and the ND Association of Counties to coordinate effective electoral processes.  This includes collaborative work with county auditors and election staff to ensure equal access to voting for all ND citizens with disabilities.

P&A closely tracked 14 voting-related bills during the 2021 Legislative Session.  While some were more directly related to people with disabilities than others, any bill can be amended, so it is imperative that all bills are monitored.  Of these bills, 12 failed and two were passed into law.  

P&A has a distribution group with more than 400 recipients that receive emails specific to disability-related legislative activities, State and federal policy initiatives, and education/training opportunities. During FY 2021 a total of 288 emails were distributed, most of which went out just prior to and during the 2021 Legislative Session.  Information included legislative bills specific to voting.  Many of these individuals and organizations forwarded these communications on to others.   

P&A tracked 183 disability-related legislative bills and study resolutions during the 2021 Legislative Session.  As mentioned above, 14 of these were related to voting.  An organized table of this information called the Disability-Related Legislative GRID was sent out to P&A's listserv at least twice/week during the 2021 Legislative Session (January - April 2021).  The GRID included: bill number with a hyperlink to the actual bill, fiscal note, short description of the bill, legislative committee to which the bill was assigned, date/time of the hearing, committee action including hyperlinks to any amendments, floor action, Governor's action; and a link to the final engrossed bill if passed.
 
During the 2021 Legislative Session, P&A also sponsored virtual Legislative Working Committee meetings each Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.  Many individuals and organizations were represented and routinely involved including people with disabilities, family members, State agencies, advocacy organizations, service providers, and Legislators.  Participation in the Friday afternoon meetings ranged between 16 and 51.  The Saturday morning meetings usually involved more people with disabilities and families, as well as an engaged Legislator.  Nine to 17 people participated in each of these meetings.  Discussion topics included many of the legislative bills being tracked.  Often discussed items included voting legislation.  The PAVA Coordinator presented on this topic a number of times, explaining the bills in participant-friendly language, and answering questions.",,,,,
ND,2023,"P&A’s policy requires the agency complete a priority setting process to guide agency operations and programming.  During FY 2023, P&A initiated its annual priority setting process for FY 2024, which included solicitation of client feedback, research and data collection on disability-related issues, and internal and external stakeholder input. The modes of information collection included electronic surveys (public comment), print surveys mailed via USPS (client input), two virtual townhall meetings (focus groups), and dialogue with staff, the advisory council, and governing board (experience).

P&A accepted public comments on FY 2024 priorities from May 19 – June 18, 2023.  Public comment information was shared via a news release, website, mailing, listserv, board meetings, and advisory council meetings. 

During the former priority setting period (FY 2023) 160 surveys were sent to clients with an overall response rate of 13%. In an effort, to gather more feedback this year, P&A widened client survey criteria.  All active advocacy cases (closed and opened) for the period of June 1, 2022 – May 15, 2023 that agreed to be surveyed at intake were asked to complete a survey.  A total of 394 surveys were sent to clients for all P&A programs with an overall response rate of 13%. Specific to ACL programs P&A had the following results:
• PADD:  191 surveys mailed; 19 returned; participation rate 10%.
• PATBI:  7 surveys mailed; 4 returned; participation rate 57%.
• PAAT:  13 surveys mailed; 2 returned; participation rate 15%.
• PAVA & PHWF: 0 surveys, non-case services.

P&A hosted a public-facing online survey to collect feedback from advocacy organizations, service providers, people with disabilities, family members, guardians, collaborative partners, advisory council members, board members, State Council on Developmental Disabilities staff and board members, and the University Center for Excellence staff and board members.  The survey was posted on P&A’s website and emailed to P&A’s listserv of 452 individuals.   A total of 26 online surveys were submitted. 

P&A held two virtual townhalls on May 23, 2023 and May 31, 2023 to gather qualitative feedback. Townhall meetings provided a brief overview on P&A services and current priorities, and then moved to questions and dialogue on disability-issues facing North Dakotans. Twelve individuals attended these events.   

In addition to public comment activities, information and data from P&A’s centralized intake and regional offices, advisory council, and board play an important role in selecting priority areas. This includes assessing requests for information & referral, emerging areas of concern related to client case work, and other trending areas in training, collaboration, and systems change.   

Each of these efforts is an integral part of the strategic planning and priority setting process used by P&A.  Feedback and information were reviewed in detail by P&A staff and formal planning was completed to ensure the priority setting process was in sync with the needs of people with disabilities in North Dakota.",,,,,
NH,2020,"DRC-NH provided testimony to NH Legislature about ADA Title II requirements to implement accessible ballot marking devices and technology for all state, local and municipal elections in NH. The committee recommended that all NH municipalities should take steps to implement accessible ballot marking technology and develop methods to publicize and encourage the use of these ballot marking devices. 

DRC-NH drafted a letter the to NH Municipal Association(NHMA) about the recommendations made by Legislative Subcommittee to provide accessible ballot marking devices for all elections. NHMA shared the letter and the subcommittee’s report and recommendations statewide with its members statewide.

The “Disability Unscripted” project began in early 2019 but culminated prior to the NH primary, and continued to garner attention long into 2020.  The project involved interviewing every major presidential candidate about their views on accessibility, employment for persons with disabilities and including  persons with disabilities on staff, should they be elected.  This project garnered national attention and resulted in DRC-NH winning the NDRN Advocacy Award. 

DRC-NH collected and published series of survey questions from all major presidential candidates. Questions touched on 5 different topics related to disability:  employment; assistive technology; special education; mental health and he shortage of direct support workers. DRC-NH received national media attention for this as well.

DRC-NH staff arranged for a voter in Hart’s Location, NH and a voter in Dixville Notch, NH to use the one4all accessible ballot marking device during the First in the Nation midnight presidential primary vote to highlight the value of an accessible voting system for people with disabilities. These events were covered by worldwide press.

DRC-NH worked with Future In Sight, an advocacy organization for people who are blind, on voting barriers for the blind community.  DRC-NH also let them borrow our one4all Ballot Marking Device (BMD) for use in their trainings throughout NH.  

DRC-NH staff participated in Poll Monitoring throughout NH for the presidential primary.  Staff traveled to 40 polling locations in New Hampshire to perform physical accessibility survey and interviewed local election officials about the use of the one4all ballot marking device.

DRC-NH met with the Secretary of State’s office to discuss concerns that DRC-NH had regarding COVID-19 and voters with disabilities. Issues included accessibility for voters with mobility impairments, sufficient person protective equipment for voters as well as people assisting voters, education of poll workers about reasonable accommodation and accessibility of the absentee voting process.

DRC-NH staff testified before the NH Secretary of State Select Committee on Voter Security. Testimony outlined the need for ADA accommodations to remain in place despite the pandemic, the potential for accessible absentee balloting, and ensuring continued access for voters who chose to cast their ballots in person. 

DRC-NH co-hosted gubernatorial candidate forum on disability issues during the primary election and began planning for a follow up forum before the general election.

DRC-NH coordinated and supported voting advocacy efforts by the NH Coalition of Blind Voters including assisting members to develop a website and advocacy goals.

DRC-NH redesigned, simplified and distributed the “Tips for Creating an Accessible Campaign” brochure to candidates and advocates across the state.

DRC-NH distributed election information in several issues of its e-newsletter. Subscribers increased from 982 to 1,110 (128 new) with an average open rate of 22.8%.

In addition to the media coverage for projects mentioned above, DRC-NH discussed voting issues for people with disabilities in the media as specified below:

DRC-NH conducted outreach to 497 people about the PAVA program and voting issues for people with disabilities.

Collaborated with racial justice and equity organizations on voting rights issues impacting people with disabilities.

Supported the development of a mental health town hall for presidential candidates which was held in Manchester NH and broadcast across the country on Facebook Live and Youtube.",,,,,
NM,2020,"The majority of DRNM's systemic work on AT in FY2020 revolved around the election process and ensuring access for people with disabilities to related information and and the voting process itself.  This work is reported in the included PAVA portion of the FY 2020 OnePPR. 

A client with cancer, paralysis, and chronic pain required a fully electronic hospital bed in order to safely transfer. DRNM advocated with the client's Managed Care Organization and then with her Medicare provider, United. United finally provided the hospital bed as prescribed by the client's doctor, and the vendor waived the $25 per month service fee. Although we prepared for Fair Hearing, this result was negotiated without having to take that step.

Client uses a wheelchair and modified vehicle. She contacted DRNM because after 8 months and paying for repairs, United Access, the only modified vehicle repair shop in NM, still had not fixed her vehicle. DRNM advocated with United Access to determine what the delay was. The process of ordering replacement parts in order to effectuate repairs and shipping the damaged parts to the manufacturer is unnecessarily convoluted. According to United Access, these types of delays are 50% attributed to the manufacturer's fault. DRNM is currently investigating why repairs take so long, especially after clients have already paid for repairs. This will involve outreach to other P&As for data on United Access offices in other states.",,,,,
NM,2021,"Need:  NMGA paragraph

Financial Exploitation Task Force (FETF)
DRNM participated in the FETF from its creation in early spring of 2020.  As planned, the FETF developed both criminal and civil statutory proposals presented during the 2021 legislative session.  Despite bipartisan support in early committee assignments, both bills died without a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The FETF continues meeting and strategizing on a path forward to secure the protections still much needed for adults vulnerable to financial exploitation.

Guardianship Training 
       DRNM’s legal director presented a training titled “Guardianships: what you need to know” to 12 participants at the NM governor's online ""Inspire AIR: Advocate, Innovate, Renew,” conference, as requested by the NM Public Education Department.

NM House Bill 234:  
       With the passage of adult guardianship reforms in House Bill 234, the New Mexico Supreme Court has formed the statutorily required Working Interdisciplinary Network of Guardianship Stakeholders (WINGS).  DRNM is represented by our legal director.  The WINGS group held our first meeting on September 9, 2021 with our next meeting set for November 30.  DRNM is committed to helping the group develop deeper reforms to honor the civil rights of people facing guardianship.

New Mexico Guardianship Association (NMGA) 
       DRNM has been a presence on the Board of the NMGA for several years, and the only voice representing the self-determination rights of protected persons in this statewide organization of guardians.  DRNM uses this platform to advocate for the least restrictive forms of substitute decision making, including 

PAVA 
       DRNM's Voting team sent letters to the New Mexico County Clerk’s offices outlining the services DRNM can provide to the counties, including surveying of polling sites, trainings and providing guidance and information on the standards set forth by the Help America Vote Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Making voting sites accessible can impact approximately 325,008 New Mexicans.  

       DRNM voting team worked with the Secretary of State’s office to create a task force dedicated to reviewing and updating their web page to make it more accessible.  We worked with the National Federation for the Blind, NM Commission for the Blind and the task force to update the absentee ballot process for individuals with visual impairment.  This include rewriting the instruction sheet for casting and returning the ballot, rewording the emails sent to individuals when they request an absentee ballot for the visually impaired  and the email they get with their ballot.  We redesigned the web page for requesting absentee ballots to make it more accessible for screen readers and user friendly.   This has the potential to impact 70,000 New Mexicans according to the statistics from the National Federation for the Blind. https://www.afb.org/research-and-initiatives/statistics/state-specific-stats/new-mexico#2019


       DRNM voting team worked with two counties under contract with the DOJ to improve accessibility for polling sites.  This included surveying over 30 sites and working with the county officials to find either permanent or temporary remediation to the accessibility issues we found.  We also provided a report of our finding for each site.  

       DRNM voting team provided trainings on voter accessibility and disability awareness for all of the county clerks at the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Election school.  We provided trainings for poll workers in Santa Fe County and worked with Sandoval County to create their ADA training for their poll workers.  

       DRNM Voting team worked with several counties to survey their polling sites and provide feedback on temporary or permanent remediation to ensure they meet the ADA standards used by the Department of Justice.  We provided a report for each site surveyed. 

Case examples 
       A DRNM Attorney worked with a client to contact the Social Security Administration (SSA) and resolve issues with the client’s representative payee. After reviewing the additional documentation we provided, SSA confirmed that the client does not need a rep. payee and will begin receiving his Supplemental Security Income payments directly again.
       
       DRNM achieved a very successful result in a guardianship transfer in Albuquerque’s Second Judicial District.  A man under a guardianship had difficulties communicating with his corporate guardian of over twenty years.  He disagreed with many of the guardian’s decisions, especially about his finances and general freedom.  The client and his family also felt that the guardian’s attitude and behavior were insulting. After initial guardianship transfer efforts failed because of funding and contractual issues at the Office of Guardianship (OOG), a DRNM attorney got creative and submitted an application with OOG for the assignment of a new guardian, and paved the way to have a new corporate guardian named relatively quickly.  We then filed a motion to transfer that guardianship to the proposed successor guardian.  When the court granted the motion, the client fulfilled his desire to move to a new apartment and is really enjoying his new guardian and life arrangements.  He is now very optimistic about his future; he told his sister, “It’s gonna be a great year for me.”",,,,,
NY,2020,"We hosted community roundtable events to discuss voter's concerns about voting during the pandemic. Through these roundtable events, our advocates received reports from over 55 voters with print disabilities across NYS expressing concerns that NYS's  Absentee Ballot Program is inaccessible to them because it was not offered in a format other than paper. Voters expressed concerns that they could not vote with any privacy or independence using the absentee ballot, and would risk contracting COVID-19 to vote. With these reports, we wrote a letter to the NYS Board of Elections Office (NYS BOE) demanding implementation of an accessible Absentee Ballot Program. The NYS BOE ignored our letter. Through the PAAT and PATBI programs, we used the information gathered from voters through the PAVA program's roundtable efforts to file a lawsuit against the NYS BOE. We hosted a Voter Hotline staffed with PAVA advocates to field questions in real time from voters across NYS. We directly assisted six voters during the 2020 elections. For example, we assisted voters in the following ways: checking the status of voter registration; contacting County Board of Elections office to resolve issues voters faced at the polls; and assisting voters in requesting accessible absentee ballots.",,,,,
NY,2021,"DRNY’s PAVA and CAP programs came together to host a series of presentations to NYS’s public university system, SUNY/CUNY.

OH,2021,"PAAT: 1. The client's mother contacted DRO for assistance with getting needed assistive technology for her son from a Medicaid managed care provider. DRO provided information to the mother on standards for requesting AT from Medicaid and guidance on the type of documentation to provide at the hearing.  The client's mother provided the information suggested by DRO documenting the need for AT and the managed care provider granted the request for AT at the hearing. 

PADD: 1. The Supreme Court of Ohio created a comprehensive toolkit for probate courts who are addressing guardianship issues for individuals with I/DD.  DRO provided input and editing to the toolkit to ensure that a wide range of information was included and that all less restrictive options were fully explained.

2. The client's mother contacted DRO with concerns that the client's IEP team had made a last minute decision to grant her a regular diploma and exit her from special education services. The parent and client wanted  the client to continue to receive special education services. DRO provided technical assistance on transition requirements and helped the client and parent develop talking points for an upcoming IEP meeting. The parent and client were able to attend IEP meeting and successfully advocate for client to defer her diploma in order to continue to receive transition services.

3. The client's father contacted Disability Rights Ohio with a concern that client was being excluded from summer programming offered by her school district because of her disability and that the criteria to get into this program was inherently discriminatory. DRO provided TA on equal access under Section 504 and contacted the school district on the client's behalf to negotiate a resolution. The district agreed to let client participate in the summer program with appropriate supports after DRO's contact. The family was pleased that client was able to participate in the summer programming. 

PATBI: 1. The client contacted DRO with questions about starting a non-profit. The client wanted to know how starting the non-profit would affect his
benefits with his SSDI, and Medicaid.  DRO provided the client with information regarding starting a non-profit as well as referrals regarding his benefits.  The client reported that he received the information he needed to move forward with his non-profit.

PAVA: 1. Client was hospitalized well before the election and had properly requested an absentee ballot. Even so, the board of elections failed to deliver an absentee ballot to client timely. As a result, hospital staff contacted DRO the day before the election and requested assistance securing a ballot for client. DRO worked with the county board of elections' absentee supervisor to have a ballot issued to client. Client received his ballot on election day and was able to complete it. A board employee then took client's completed ballot back to the board of elections, meaning client was able to vote in the election.

2. Client has neuropathy in both legs, diabetes, kidney disease, history of back surgeries. As a result of his disabilities, he cannot stand in line for long periods because his legs go out and he falls down.  He also cannot sit in his chair for long periods due to neuropathy. There were long lines at the polls with long wait times. The client asked DRO for help with curb-side voting. With client’s permission DRO contacted the county board of elections to gather information about any specific processes for curbside voting and provided this information to the client. PAAT:
A. Monitor a Variety of Facilities and Other Regulated Entities - DRO conducted remote monitoring activities at a rehabilitation center.  The monitoring activity focused on all aspects of care, including the physical environment, use of assistive technology, quality of care provided to patients, programming and overall quality of life.  DRO also examined the facility's COVID protocols and safety-related issues.  DRO discovered that the facility had a large COVID outbreak; the Ohio Department of Health was heavily involved with this facility to address issues with infection control.  DRO reviewed the measures the facility put in place regarding infection control as well as all other aspects of the facility.  DRO noted a few minor issues, and followed up with facility leadership to remedy them. 

B. Abuse & Neglect Investigations  -  Disability Rights Ohio has received multiple reports from incarcerated Deaf individuals at one Ohio prison, who report several issues with the assistive technology provided to them by the prison.  For example, inmates who rely on video phones reported unequal access because other inmates are able to make phone calls from prison-provided tablets at any time.  However, the prison only has three video phones and one TTY for Deaf and hearing impaired individuals, and often there is a long wait to use those phones.  Additionally, the video phones are not in a private location and conversations are monitored by prison staff’s physical presence – this is not true for inmates who can use their tablets to make calls.  Inmates also cannot access the video phones if they have “tickets” due to movement restrictions – this rule is not applicable to inmates who can use tablets.   
Another issue reported to DRO is that captioning on the prison-provided tablets is limited.  Only about 1/3 of movies have captioning – movies most recently added to the tablets had none.  Some individuals paid for movies that said had closed captioning, but did not.  They have not received refunds for those purchases.  
Finally, the incarcerated individuals reported a lack of training for prison staff on how to communicate with individuals who are Deaf or hard of hearing.  This lack of training is leading to disciplinary or safety issues for the inmates.  One client reported that when he was being taken to the medical unit, the corrections officers told the client to walk ahead of them.  The client did not know where he was going and tried to communicate to the corrections officers that he could not hear their directions. The corrections officers were armed at the time and the client reported being afraid that he would be shot because the corrections officers might mistake his communication for defiance. 
DRO is addressing these matters with the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections and evaluating options to address the systemic issues. 

C. Redress Barriers Caused by Ineffective Communication in Jails and Prisons - Client is Deaf and currently incarcerated in prison. The client reported that several months ago, his hearing aids stopped working, and he turned them over to the facility for repair. Several months passed and he had not received an update or repaired hearing aids. Client asked DRO to advocate on his behalf. DRO contacted counsel for ODRC and requested both an update and that Client receive working hearing aids. Approximately one week later, ODRC confirmed that Client's hearing aids were sent out for repair under warranty, but they could not be repaired. Client was seen by audiology on the day DRO contacted ODRC, and new hearing aids have been ordered.

PADD:
A. Monitor a Variety of Facilities and Other Regulated Entities - 1. This year, DRO engaged in extensive monitoring activities in ICFs.  The focus of those activities was to ensure people have the information they need about exit waivers and are connected to resources to make an informed choice about exit waivers and transitioning from private ICFs to community settings. DRO advocates monitored 19 ICFs and spoke with numerous individuals to identify whether they had ever received information about exit waivers or options counseling and to provide the informaiton if they had not received it and wanted it. DRO also spoke with individuals' guardians to provide more information about the client's community living options.  In some instances, when the guardian supported a community placement, DRO was able to 
facilitate the exit waiver process.  For example, DRO's Abuse and Neglect Team met with one individual in an ICF who expressed interest in an exit waiver.  A member of DRO's Civil Rights and Community Integration team assisted the individual and his guardian with the exit waiver process
2. DRO advocates monitored a state-operated developmental center virtually. DRO met with the leadership team, spoke with direct care staff, facilities managers, administrator, nurses and others. DRO also toured the facility (virtually), including several buildings that are dedicated to recreation. Finally, DRO met with several clients to interview them about their experience. DRO found this facility to be maintaining a clean environment, to be providing a robust activities calendar (during the one-hour tour, we saw four separate activities being conducted with a high level of engagement) and to be providing a high level of care. We received much positive feedback from the residents, including “Staff are very good. I like my stay here.”  “I feel safe with staff.” One resident interviewed remarked that they enjoyed that they went on hikes and had scavenger hunts. Another resident remarked that they enjoyed making crafts. When asked if staff treat them with dignity and respect, one resident reported, “They’re all good. All these people are good to me”. We provided this positive feedback to leadership. DRO found no outstanding items for follow up for this facility. 

B. Abuse & Neglect Investigations - 1. DRO investigated the death of an individual who left a day program without staff knowing and was subsequently hit by a car on the highway.  DRO reviewed extensive records, including police reports, incident reports, supervision plans and training records.  The individual was to receive one-to-one supervision because of a past incident.  As a result of the incident, the day program retrained its staff regarding supervision and disciplined/terminated staff involved in the incident.  DRO also followed up with law enforcement regarding criminal charges.  
2. DRO received a report from a client at a developmental center about an incident involving staff abuse. An interview was conducted with client regarding the incident. After receiving consent, DRO reviewed records related to the incident and was unable to find evidence of abuse by staff. DRO spoke to the client about the formal grievance process and assisted him with filing one with his program manager. DRO also called the developmental center to ensure they followed up on the grievance. Client stated he was happy with the outcome of the grievance and had no additional concerns. 
3. DRO investigated trends and patterns of alleged abuse regarding a specific employee of a state-operated developmental center.  DRO reviewed all reports of incidents involving this employee, documents related to the disciplinary actions against the alleged perpetrator, historical evidence of trends of allegations against this employee, and conducted multiple interviews with the victims via video call. DRO met with staff, leadership, and legal counsel and asked that this staff person be removed from direct care of individuals for whom allegations had been documented.  The developmental center declined to remove the individual because of protections provided by the employees' union. DRO expressed concern about possible trauma that the victims may be experiencing if in proximity to the employee. The developmental center agreed to put in place a long-term plan to conduct trauma timelines for the individuals and provide appropriate treatment.  DRO conducts regular visits to the developmental center to ensure the safety of the residents.

PATBI:
A. Monitor a Variety of Facilities and Other Regulated Entities - DRO conducted a virtual monitoring at an adult residential care facility that serves individuals with traumatic brain injury and mental illness. DRO met with the facility director and owner to go over the questionnaire about their facility and covid-19 protocols. DRO took a virtual tour of the home and noted items of concern related to safety issues; cords hanging down, dirty bath mats, obstructions in doorways. Overall, residents reported positive experience living there and had no concerns. The facility responded in a timely manner to follow-up letter and sent pictures with the corrections that they made. 

B. Abuse & Neglect Investigations - The client's mother contacted DRO when her son died in prison under suspicious circumstances. DRO reviewed records, including third-party investigative records, video, and the Coroner's Report. DRO also conducted numerous meetings with Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections to provide access authority information and to advocate for the client. DRO also provided the client's mother with an attorney referral.  As a result of this case, DRO uncovered a systemic issue at the prison and continues to work with ODRC to remedy the concern identified. 
 
C.  Redress barriers to mental health care caused by COVID-19 in jails and prisons - After receiving reports of inadequate health care at one of Ohio's largest jails, DRO launched a 20-month investigation into the jail's practices and services. This jail located in one of Ohio's largest urban cities holds a large number of racial minorities. Over the course of the investigation, DRO conducted interviews with over 160 incarcerated individuals, reviewed numerous records, conducted multiple site visits, and met several times with jail officials.  The results of DRO's investigation culminated in a public report issued in January 2021 that detailed key findings, including: a lack of access to adequate medical care; a lack of access to meaningful mental health care; staff shortages and a culture of misconduct and abuse; and an inaccessible facility.  DRO also found that the jail has not met several obligations under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Many of the issues described in the report, including those related to medical and mental health care and the physical facility, may be the result of the jail's failure to meet Title II requirements.  Throughout the investigation, DRO has advocated with jail officials to make widespread, systemic changes in the facility.  While the jail has made some improvements in the areas of healthcare, DRO continues to explore strategic approaches to the issues, including focusing on improving preventive practices such as diversion programs and increases in community supports to reduce levels of incarceration altogether.

PAVA:
A. Monitor a Variety of Facilities and Other Regulated Entities - 1. DRO completed a virtual monitoring at a state-operated developmental center.  The purpose of the visit was to ensure that the DC is providing rights education and protection, with a focus on voting rights.  A virtual tour was completed on one of their cohort units and DRO met with facility administration. Interviews were completed with residents, who had positive things to say about their stay at the DC. DRO continued to work with the facility to provide ongoing information on residents' voting rights.  
2. DRO completed a virtual monitoring visit of a state-operated psychiatric hospital to monitor compliance with health and safety obligations and to provide information to the residents about their rights on a variety of topics, including voting rights. DRO met with facility leadership and residents regarding the quality of care provided.  DRO provided information to the residents about the P&A system and voting.  DRO did not have concerns about the care provided to the residents at this psychiatric hospital. PAVA:
A. Targeted voting outreach - Prior to the November 2020 presidential election, DRO conducted state-wide outreach to educate people with disabilities on their voting rights. DRO employees were divided in teams with each team responsible for certain categories of facilities (e.g. residential treatment centers, psychiatric hospitals, DD facilities, and nursing facilities). DRO created written materials that were provided in advance to the residents of the facilities and DRO conducted each presentation virtually in compliance with COVID-19 guidance. Each outreach team also recorded presentations that were then sent to facilities who did not have the technology to support a virtual presentation. DRO also provided time to each facility so that residents could call and speak privately with DRO staff if they had questions. DRO offered a survey to the facilities after each presentation and received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the outreach project.

B. Systemic and individual voting advocacy - 1. Client was unexpectedly hospitalized after the statutory deadline to request an absentee ballot. Disability Rights Ohio worked with hospital staff to submit an absentee ballot request to the county board of elections on client's behalf. 
2. The client had stage 4 cancer and could not stand in the long lines at her polling location.  She contacted DRO for assistance with curbside voting.  DRO provided information on curbside voting, reasonable accommodations, and offered to reach out to board of elections for client.  The client went to the polls and reported that she was able to vote curbside without issue.  The client was grateful to DRO for the information. 
3. DRO conducted targeted outreach to individuals in public and private psychiatric facilities on voting rights.  The purpose of the outreach was to provide information to individuals and hospital staff about the voting rights of people who are unexpectedly hospitalized just before or on Election Day.  DRO also created materials to be distributed to hospital patients and assisted hospital staff in creating plans to help unexpectedly hospitalized patients vote on Election Day. 
4. DRO staff participated in a panel with advocates from the Ohio Voter Rights Coalition at the League of Women Voters Bicentennial conference. The training focused on the rights of voters with disabilities and tips for how to advocate for them.

C. Voter hotline for November 2020 general election - We operated a voter hotline for the November 2020 general election.  We received a number of calls from people in psychiatric hospitals who needed to use a special process that requires personal delivery of their ballots by county elections officials or other accommodations.  This has been a recurring issue in Ohio, as many of these voters need DRO’s advocacy to ensure the process works properly, especially for those hospitalized outside of their county of residence.  We were able to advocate for four voters to get their ballots on Election Day.  Other voters, unfortunately, did not ultimately receive their ballots, either because of failures in the system or late submission of the ballot request or because they were not admitted to the hospital within the statutory time frame.  This advocacy will inform our future advocacy with the Ohio Secretary of Ohio to ensure voters in hospitals have equal access to cast a ballot.
We also provided information and guidance through our hotline to six people who wanted information on how to vote curbside outside of their polling location.  This was a popular accommodation, as many people voting in person on Election Day were nevertheless fearful of voting indoors because of the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic.

D. Evaluate impact of COVID-19 on the electoral process - We are finalizing a public report describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to the electoral system for voters with disabilities.  The Ohio Secretary of State and county boards of elections implemented new measures to accommodate voters during the state of emergency, but challenges—many of them are longstanding and precede the pandemic—remain.  Our report is based on our work on individual requests for advocacy, advice, or information, both through our hotline on Election Day and throughout the fiscal year; our systemic advocacy on a number of issues to expand opportunities for voters with disabilities and to ensure equal access; and other collaborations with other voting rights groups in Ohio. Additionally, DRO's outreach to voters in a number of settings helped us learn about various obstacles individuals face.  
Our report is focused on four major area where systemic barriers exist—people unexpectedly hospitalized before Election Day, voters in nursing facilities and other institutional settings, voters who need to vote curbside, and voters with vision impairments who need to use the remote absentee ballot marking tool-- and includes recommendations for change in these systems.  We plan to engage with the Ohio Secretary of State and also the county boards of elections first.",,,,,
OH,2023,"1. (PAAT, PADD, PATBI, PAVA) DRO collaborated with stakeholders to establish the Accessibility Committee and hosted the workgroup. This group established a one-page document for policymakers and state agencies to use to make virtual meetings fully accessible for disabled Ohioans. Further, DRO collaborated with the Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities to ensure their trainings, meetings, and any other event hosted by the department were fully accessible. Finally, DRO collaborated with legislative offices to ensure committee hearings, meetings, and the legislative process were accessible for disabled Ohioans. 

2. (PAAT, PADD, PATBI) Members of Leadership team attended 2023 Multiethnic Advocates for Cultural Competence (MACC, Inc.) Annual Conference “From Advocacy to Activism” and participated in sessions that focus on workshops to enhance understanding and skills related to intersectionality, cultural humility, and culturally responsive leadership to enhance rights education, protection, and advocacy when working with individuals with disabilities and mentoring agency staff.

3. (PAAT, PADD, PATBI, PAVA) DRO coordinated with disabled advocates, partner organizations, and policy makers throughout the state biennial budget to advocate for increased wages for direct care worker wages. HB 33 ended up being passed with one of the largest increases in the HCBS system with an emphasis on increasing wages for direct care workers.

4. (PADD, ACL-PHWF) DRO collaborated with several disability-led advocacy groups and helped support the creation of additional advocacy groups over the past year to advocate for higher wages for direct care workers. This work was accomplished by bringing together all advocates across the state and building out skills for new advocates to be strong effective advocates throughout the state biennial budget. DRO collaborated with organizations across disability and identity to ensure advocacy was taking an intersectional approach. 1. (PADD, PATBI, PAAT) In FY23, we had regular meetings with the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (“ODRC”), where we advocated for increased mental health services, better constant watch conditions, and other changes to ODRC’s facilities, policies, and procedures that would benefit people in carceral settings who are experiencing suicidal ideations or other mental health concerns. We also addressed specific cases as they arose, working with individuals and ODRC to address those individual’s need for mental health services, placement in a different facility, or other potential remedies. We leveraged our relationship with ODRC as needed to have well-checks performed by facility staff when we became aware of individuals expressing immediate threats of harm to self or others.

2.  (PAAT) Client is Deaf and currently incarcerated in state prison. Client reported to DRO that he and other Deaf inmates can only use video phone one time per day for 45 minutes. Hearing inmates can use their GTL tablets to make phone calls until 8:30pm from anywhere in the facility. The client's family is in California, so it was difficult to reach them during his one time slot per day. The prison video phone also malfunctioned and they were unable to make any calls for a week. The client submitted grievances on teh issues without response.   DRO advocated with the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC) for client to improved video phone services.  The client was eventually released from prison and DRO lost contact.  However, DRO used the video phone and other information provided by the client to advocate generally for AT improvements at all ODRC facilities. For example, due to DRO's advocacy, ODRC and GTL (ODRC's tablet vendor) agreed to develop, beta, and fully implement a closed captioning software on all ODRC tablets. GTL is also working to made video calls available on the tablet.

3. (PADD, PATBI, PAAT, PAVA) This year, in DRO’s monitoring of youth  residential treatment facilities, advocates added questions regarding gender identity and pronouns. We also asked youth during site visits if they were treated with respect regarding their personal identities (gender identity, race, sexual orientation, religion). Additionally, DRO asked questions to each facility’s leadership pertaining to anti-bullying curriculum inclusive of LGBTQIA+ content and onboarding training of staff that incorporated LGBTQIA+ content in the agency’s cultural competency training.  DRO found that most of the youth residential treatment facilities were not addressing the unique treatment needs of LGTBQIA+ youth, had little culturally relevant onboarding curriculum for staff inclusive of this historically marginalized population, and that there was little inclusion of LGBTQIA+ content integrated in their antibullying work. As a result of DRO’s targeted advocacy efforts almost all the facilities monitored in FY23 had a more formalized client and staff education plan, staff training curriculum, and anti-bullying processes that included the use of gender-affirming pronouns selected by the youth at the time the monitoring project was closed. 

Lastly, Disability Rights Ohio included mental health youth residential treatment facilities as a targeted setting for our FY24 community input on goal and objective setting process during FY23.  We received 94 surveys back from youth residing menta health residential treatment facilities.  42% of the youth responding to the surveys identified as being part of the LGBTQIA+ community, further demonstrating the prevalence of this population found in the youth populations residing in Ohio’s residential treatment facilities. 


4. (PADD)  DRO investigated an allegation of physical assualt that occurred at a state-operated developmental center.  A resident reported that a staff member kicked him in his side resulting in injury.  DRO met with the individual and reviewed information related to the incident. The staff member was terminated from employment and remaining staff were retrained on appropriate resident care.

(PATBI) DRO investigated claims that a nursing agency was not providing appropriate care for client - an individual with a traumatic brain injury. DRO spoke with the client and guardians regarding the issues as well as obtained medical records from the agency.  After reviewing the information, DRO provided additional resources to the client to pursue possible claims.  The client obtained an attorney to address the matter further. 

5. (PADD, PATBI, PAAT, PAVA) DRO conducted a monitoring visit of a state-opearted developmental center.  The visit was conducted virutally due to high COVID numbers at the facility. DRO monitored this Developmental Center for all aspects of daily living, personal care, engagement, health and safety and addressed items of concern in follow-up letter of recommendations to the facility.  DRO's recommendations addressed patient rights and treatment concerns, individual concerns reported by residents related to covid vaccination, needs for specialists, and needs for mental health care. DRO also recommended training of all staff in anti-bullying practices and LGBTQ+ sensitivity. DRO received a letter from the facility with documents verifying that the facility addressed each of DRO's concerns or recommendations.  

6. (PAAT, PATBI) DRO completed a on-site monitoring at a residential treatment facility for youth. DRO's monitoring included meeting with leadership, facility tour, and resident interviews. DRO had monitored the facility the previous fiscal year and noted that the facility had made significant progress since the previous monitoring and made changes to their trauma-informed care programming. Residents noted a positive difference in services they were receiving. DRO also followed up on concerns regarding some aspects of the environment and resident rights. The facility responded and implemented DRO's recomendations.",,,,,
OK,2020,"ODLC’s 2020 PAVA work included efforts to make our election process safe and accessible during the COVID-19 Pandemic.  ODLC worked with the State Legislators as well as the State Election Board to ensure voters with disabilities had options for absentee voting that would allow them to minimize their risk of possible exposure to COVID-19.  In anticipation of an increase in the use of Absentee Ballots, ODLC more than doubled the number of staff in both offices who are Notary Publics and widely publicized the ability of our staff to notarize ballots.  ODLC also worked with the State Election Board and Legislators to successfully establish an alternative to ballot notarization, giving voters the option to submit a copy of their photo ID with their ballot in lieu of notarization, thus reducing another potential point of COVID exposure.  We continued to publicize our Voter Hotline and ran PSA announcements on local radio stations alerting the public to their voting rights and the availability of ODLC staff to answer questions, provide training and advocacy in the area of voter rights.",,,,,
OK,2021,"ODLC’s 2021 PAVA work continues to include efforts to make our election process safe and accessible during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Even in light of the continuing COVID-19 Pandemic, the Oklahoma legislature chose to end the special provision put in place in 2020 and reinstated the requirement for absentee ballots to be notarized.  ODLC conducted a public awareness campaign to ensure voters were aware of the return of the notarization requirement.  ODLC also used our social media and website to offer notarization services through both our Tulsa and Oklahoma City offices.  We continued to publicize our Voter Hotline as a resource for information on changing voter requirements.",,,,,
PR,2020,"The Permanent Inscriptions Boards (PIB’s) are the place where the voters go to make all the registration process.  This is the place where persons with disabilities come to request accessible voting, in the Accessible Voting College (AVC). For this reason, it should be accessible of any physical barrier. 
After the economic crisis in PR, to reduce budget expenses, SEC established a plan to reduce the number of PIB’s.  Some of the PIB’s were consolidated, others are moving to state facilities.  This year PAVA Advocates inspected 33 Permanent Inscriptions Boards (PIB’s) in order to eliminate the any physical barrier.  PIB´s are the physical locations to register to vote. In each Permanent Inscription Board visited, we orientated inscription officials about accessibility and equal treatment of persons with disabilities in the electoral environment.  
Of the 33 monitories, 17 of them were follow up from last fiscal year. The PIB’s inspected this fiscal year were the following:  
1. PIB San Juan Central Office SEC

Summary of important events:

On June 26, 2020, days before closing the Registration Process for the Democratic Party Presidential Primaries;  PAVA advocates monitories three PIB’s (SEC Central Office, San Juan 3, and Carolina) to verify accessibility and the availability of the preference line or express line (to comply with Act 297 of 2018 that request the development of a preference turns or express line for people with disabilities). After we discusses with President Davila our findings that includes the lack of complying with Act 297 of 2018, on June 29, 2020, SEC President establishes a procedure for priority turns in PIB’s: persons with disabilities, with more than 60 year, and women pregnant will have priority in the lines of PIB.

On July 15, 2020, days before closing the Registration Process for the local Parties Primaries; PAVA advocates monitories two PIB’s (PIB Cataño and PIB Guaynabo) to verify accessibility and the availability of the preference line or express line (to comply with Act 297 of 2018 that request the development of a preference turns or express line for people with disabilities).

On August 16, 2020, at the second part of the Parties Primaries, PAVA advocates monitories two PIB (Loiza and Canóvanas), looking for the Vote by Phone option.  In the polling places of Canóvanas and Loiza, poll workers told us, that the Vote by Phone was in PIB.  Regrettably, Vote by Phone briefcase were in PIB, when it should be available in the polling places. Both Loiza and Canóvanas PIB don’t have any accessibility issues.

On September 9, 2020, PAVA advocates receive notification from SEC officials of a new facility, PIB in the Precinct 5 that include electors of San Juan, Guaynabo and Aguas Buenas Counties.  PAVA Director made an ocular inspection to the new facility an old school, already close, located in Caimito, San Juan.  Fortunately, the facility complies with ADA and HAVA regulations.  In the monitory we share information about PAVA, and the importance of an accessible electoral process with one of the Governor Candidates, Alexandra Lugaro, Esq. representing the Movement of Citizen Victory.

On September 14, 2020, the last day before the Registration Process for the local Parties Primaries, that includes the request of Absentee and Advance Vote, PAVA advocates monitories five PIB’s (PIB Guaynabo, PIB Caguas, PIB Cayey, PIB Cidra, PIB Aguas Buenas) to verify accessibility and the availability of the preference line or express line (to comply with Act 297 of 201 that request the development of a preference turns or express line for people with disabilities). In these monitories we investigated and verify the complying of the SEC President memo, that create the procedure of priority turns for electors with disabilities among others.

The performance measure of this objective: Registering people with disabilities to vote, Public and private places/services made more accessible and People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. If each PIB´s is accessible, persons with disabilities will have the opportunity to register in the election and further participates in the electoral process. With these Projects People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. Of the 33 Permanent Inscription Board inspected, 14 had accessibility problems, Rio Grande, Morovis, Caguas, Juncos, Ceiba, San Lorenzo, Fajardo, Patillas, Rincon, Lajas, Ponce, Salinas, Guayanilla and Toa Baja Counties.  In the case of Rio Grande and Caguas, both remains opened despite the barriers were addressed in October 2020, so it will be report in next fiscal year.  Unfortunately, the other 12 remain inaccessible after September 30, 2020.
The main findings were:
 1. San Lorenzo - Lack of Accessible Parking, Door Entrance of only 30 inches
2. Ceiba – Completely Inaccessible
3. Fajardo - Irregularities in the accessible route and lack of handrails
4. Patillas - Inaccessible Ramp
5. Caguas - Lack of Accessible Parking
6. Toa Baja - Lack of Accessible Parking 
7. Morovis - Step in the entrance
8. Rincón - Lack of Accessible Parking
9. Lajas - Completely Inaccessible

11. Salinas - Lack of Accessible Parking
12. Guayanilla - Lack of Accessible Parking and step in the entrance.
13.    Juncos - Step in the entrance
14.    Rio Grande - Step in the entrance

With an open complaint, PAVA advocates present the situation to the President or the designated person, who will look for either alternative, remove the physical barriers or relocate the PIB to an accessible facility. The PIB’s must be finally accessible for November 2020, General Elections.

The performance measure of this objective: Registering people with disabilities to vote, Public and private places/services made more accessible and People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. If each PIB´s is accessible, persons with disabilities will have the opportunity to register in the election and further participates in the electoral process. With these Projects People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. Before Pandemic PAVA advocates performed two trainings:
1. October 19, 2020 on “Centro Esperanza para la Vejez” in Ponce county, where PAVA Advocates impacted 19 persons, 17 of them, identifies themselves as persons with disabilities.
2. January 27, 2020 on MMM Members Club in Hatillo County, PAVA Advocates impacted 28 persons, 22 of them, identifies themselves as persons with disabilities.
Due the COVID 19 Pandemic, PAVA had to innovate to educate our main target, electors with disabilities, and polling workers.  In August 19, 2020, PAVA began a radio program named Accessible Vote 2020 that was aired in WIPR 940AM Wednesday at 2pm thru 3pm until General Elections. In terms of this report we will inform the Radio Programs aired until September 30, 2020. The Program was held on August 19, 26, September 2, 9,16,23, and 30, 2020. We understand that this 7 Radio Programs can impact an estimate of 25,000 persons each Program. For a total of 175,000 individuals including persons with disabilities, and another general public.  Using the estimate of 21.6%, the impact can be almost 37,800 electors with disabilities.
We participate in another 21 radio interviews in different radio stations, including:
1. Five (5) in Radio WISA 1390 AM, Isabela, we an estimate audience of 10,000 in the west area (July 9, 17, 31 August 7, 2020 and September 4, 2020). 
2. Three (3) in WAPA Radio 680AM, we an estimate audience of 25,000 island wide (July 17, August 7, September 14, 2020)
3. Six (6) in Radio Victoria 840AM, we an estimate audience of 10,000 in the east area (March 13, 2020, July 7, 2020, August 4, 2020, August 26,2020, September 1, 2020 and September 7, 2020)
4. Two (2) in Radio Oro 92.5FM, we an estimate audience of 50,000 island wide (July 5 and 11, 2020) 
5. One (1) in Krystal Radio Virtual FM, we an estimate audience of 5,000 island wide (July 13, 2020)
6. One (1) in Radio WASA 850AM, Aguadilla, we an estimate audience of 10,000 in the west area (August 7, 2020)
7. One (1) in Radio WPAB 550AM, Ponce, we an estimate audience of 10,000 in the south area (August 7, 2020)
8. One (1) in Radio 810AM, the number 1 Program in prime time 6pm Fuego Cruzado we an estimate audience of 25,000 island wide (August 9, 2020)
9. One (1) in Radio Isla 1320, we an estimate audience of 25,000 island wide (August 9, 2020)
In each interview performed, PAVA Director covered the following:
1. HAVA Act and the importance of accessibility for electors with disabilities.
2. PAVA Program achievements
3. Accessibility options and alternatives for electors with disabilities, who want to participate in the voting process.
4. Special Accommodations in the Accessible Voting Center (AVC).
5. Sensitivity towards persons with disabilities in an electoral environment.
6. Information about the registration process.
7. Requirement of Vote by Phone to comply with HAVA section 301 (3b)
 
An estimate of 560,000 audience was reach for all the radio Programs.  If we multiple this by 21.6%, the estimate of impacted electors with disabilities should be 120,090.

The performance measure of this objective: People with disabilities trained to become active participants in making decisions that affect their lives, Education and training of people with disabilities on their voting rights.
Despite the purposes of this priority is to educate persons with disabilities, we include general public, who´s can spread the information among family or relatives with disabilities. In each radio interview, PAVA advocates promotes the existing accessibility tools available in the electoral process. With outreach activities, PAVA advocates spread the message of the Program, the importance of having an accessible electoral process, where electors with disabilities can cast their vote secretly and with independence.  
One example before Pandemic Crisis; on November 20, 2020, PAVA advocates, participates in a Fair at the “Universidad Adventista de las Antillas” on Mayaguez”. In this Fair PAVA Advocates, oriented 17 participants, three of them, identifies themselves as persons with disabilities. PAVA impacted students and professors educating them about PAVA and HAVA provisions.  In this fiscal year PAVA distributed 719 flyers with PAVA information. 
This year in Puerto Rico due COVID 19 Pandemic we didn’t have other alternative than the use media to disseminate PAVA provisions.
We participated in 21 radio programs, described in previous objective. As we established above, we produce our own Radio Program called Accessible Vote 2020, in this fiscal we presented 7 shows, each one aired every Wednesday at 2pm thru 3pm in WIPR 940am. Each Program had different sections:
1. Rights for disabled electors – where we described and explained importance laws regarding the rights of electors with disabilities, including HAVA Act and ADA, among others.
2. Accessible Vote 2020 Answers your question – where we answer questions and doubts that we receive in the week.  This was a direct advocacy, for individuals who requested it.
3. History of Electoral Accessibility in Puerto Rico – where a blind advocate of our agency explained his experience and the advances of accessibility in the electoral process in Puerto Rico, since the beginning where blind and disabled couldn’t vote independently until HAVA and Vote by Phone.
4. Electoral School – where we explain the audience how to cast their vote and the electoral provisions provides by HAVA.

We had been covered on written press including TV, Radio and Internet, 62 of them are reported with Internet links, the majority in Spanish, a few in English.

In social media like Facebook, all TV, radio and written press reports were copied to add outreach of PAVA efforts.
We also have a web page www.dpi.pr.gov where we have information about PAVA and had 15,828 hits this fiscal year. As we established above due COVID 19, PAVA advocates, used media instead of services fairs and paper brochures used in previous years, to disseminate the information.  In each outreach efforts, PAVA advocates explained the importance of giving the specials accommodations to persons with intellectual developmental disabilities and persons with other disabilities in the electoral process, PAVA provisions, HAVA and ADA Act, among other information to developed self-advocacy skills.
The purpose of the different interventions in the media is to educate future voters about: 
1. Rights of persons with disabilities, 
2. The voting process, 
3. The accessibility of the polling places and the AVC
4. The alternative Vote at Home, where a designated Board representing the political parties let persons with mobility disabilities cast the vote in their home, dates before the Election Day
5. The alternative Vote in Hospital, where SEC designated a Board representing the political parties let people hospitalized cast their vote in the hospital’s room.
6. The alternative of Vote by Phone System.
The performance measure of this objective: Education and training of people with disabilities on their voting rights. The importance of this priority is to educate general public, who´s can spread the information among family or relatives with disabilities.
This objective impacts all electors with disabilities. When you used almost all the media in several times, some of them in prime time, you can estimate that all electors with disabilities receive the information. The estimate based in the Census 2019 is 21.6% of the electors available to vote in 2020, 2,355,894 * 0.216% = 508,873 PAVA advocates provided recommendations and planning strategies for the electoral process, taking consideration the special needs of people with disabilities, having meetings with policy makers. As we educated Policy Makers, we achieve advocacy on behalf electors with disabilities.
On Election year, despite COVID 19 Pandemic, PAVA advocates worked with SEC to improves accessibility, and to achieves an electoral process with independently and secretly for electors with disabilities. 
Summarize of major events:
On October 28, 2019, PAVA Director have a meeting with New Progressive Party (NPP) Commissioner.  The purpose was to request the participation as observers of PAVA in the special elections of November 10, 2019, that will fill two vacant of this party, in the Senate. The NPP Commissioner respond affirmative to our request.  We also discuss important accessibilities issues for next electoral events. 
On November 10, 2019, SEC had a special election to fill two Senates vacant island wide and two mayors of two cities Barranquitas and Humacao. PAVA Director and other advocates performed monitories to 21 polling places.  After the monitories PAVA Director went to SEC Central Office to communicate with policy makers specifically we had meetings with NPP Electoral Commissioner Guzman, with Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, with DPP Electoral Commissioner Lin Merle and with SEC President Judge Dávila. In the individual’s meetings with policy makers we discuss the importance of the vote of electors with disabilities with emphasis in secrecy and independency of the process.
On February 28, 2020, PAVA Advocates, performed monitories, before the Democratic Party Presidential Primaries, to the Permanent Inscription Boards (PIB) of San Juan, Precinct 1.  The objective was to verify the compliance of Act 297 of 2018 that creates a priority line or express line in public services, including the registration process in PIB. We find the PIB accessible and orient elections officials about accessibility y and equal treatment to disabled community.
On June 26, 2020, PAVA Advocates, performed monitories before the Party Primaries to the Permanent Inscription Board (PIB) of Carolina and San Juan. As a result of reports of lack of compliance with Act 297 of 2018 that creates a priority line or express line in public services, including the registration process in PIB, PAVA advocates, decide to enforce it by monitories. When we find the lack of compliance, we communicate with SEC President and the Electoral Commissioners of the New Progressive Party (NPP) and Democratic Popular Party (DPP). They agreed with PAVA Director, to have a meeting to discuss the situation next day early in the morning.  Almost four hours later we received copy of an official memorandum with orders to electoral officials to comply with Law 297 of 2018 among other instructions, to improve the services to electors with disabilities in the registration process.  PAVA sent a press release to media to disseminate the order and the achievement.
On July 15, 2020, PAVA Advocates, performed other monitories to the Permanent Inscription; the last day to request Advance and Absentee Voting for the Party Primaries. In this occasion we performed monitories to San Juan, Cataño y Guaynabo. In these monitories we ask elections officials about Advance and Absentee Vote option. We announce this kind of voting options in media with the help of SEC officials. Days after we found an historic number of 227,812 electors requesting forms of Absentee and Advance Vote. Electors with disabilities or older than 60 years old (to protect elderly due COVID 19) requested Advance Voting in one of the three methods, Vote by Mail 54,713, Vote at Home 105,331, Early Voting in an accessible polling place 53,195.  This historical number was a result of the Pandemic, and PAVA efforts, with SEC officials to include secure options for persons with low immune systems, like cancer, HIV, organs transplant and other diseases. This increase was also a result of PAVA Advocates media efforts to disseminate the options for electors with disabilities whose want to participate in the electoral process but were afraid of COVID 19.

On August 2020, PAVA Director, have several telephones independent meetings with the Electoral Commissioners of the Active Political Parties, New Progressive Party (NPP), Democratic Popular Party (DPP), Citizen Victorious Movement (CVM) and the Independence Puerto Rican Party (IPP).  With each meeting we advocate for the following:

1. Analyze alternatives for compliance with accessible voting equipment’s, specifically Vote by Phone and Dominium Voting System used in previous elections.
2. Accessibility of the PIB´s including the open cases of Caguas, Rio Grande, Toa Baja and Morovis Towns, among others.
3. Follow up of the reactivation of the HAVA State Planning Committee, of any other subcommittee like the Education and Training Committee, and our commitment to helps with the participation of the disabled community.
4. New Electoral Code approved in July 2020 and new alternatives like Vote by Mail 
5. Braille in each polling place
6. Vote by Phone to comply with HAVA section 301 (3b)
7. Advance Vote for persons with immune systems, like transplants patients, patients with cancer, AIDS or other diseases that can feel insecure due COVID 19.
8. Selecting Accessible Polling Places (at the end of fiscal year, September 30, 2020, SEC didn’t present the official list of polling places)
9. Vote at Home
10. Vote at Hospitals

On September 2020, PAVA advocates continued to advocate with new SEC administration, due resign of former President Davila.  The first thing PAVA Director do after knowing the named of President Rosado and alternate President Padilla, was to warns them by a press release about the importance of accessibility issues, asking to comply with HAVA provisions, including section 301 (3b).
The Electoral Commissioners with the SEC President forms the Commission, responsible of establish public policy. PAVA advocates for disabled rights in each instance.
As a result of all these meeting with Commission members, they committed to follow up the recommendations of PAVA, and to achieve accessibility in the electoral process in compliance with HAVA Act.

The performance measure of this objective are: Education and training of election officials, volunteers and poll workers regarding rights of people with disabilities and best practices, Registering people with disabilities to vote, Public and private places/services made more accessible and People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. With these Project we developed a strategy to educate the main policy maker, the Commission, as a group can enforce the requested of accessibility in the elections process and HAVA Act. PAVA advocates provided recommendations and planning strategies for the electoral process, taking into consideration the special needs of people with disabilities, having telephone and virtual meeting with policy makers (due Covid 19 Pandemic). As we educated Policy Makers, we make system advocacy on behalf electors with disabilities.
As we mention in previous objective, PAVA advocates provoked changes, including changes to the new Electoral Code Act 58 of June 28, 2020.
On October 2019, PAVA Director had a meeting with NPP Commissioner Guzman. NPP was the party with majority in the Senate, where his President Rivera Schatz was the author of the new Electoral Code. At the time, the new Code was evaluating in the Senate.  PAVA Director have access to the documents and made recommendations, including proper vocabulary, for disabled community, the importance of HAVA act 2002, alternatives of Advance Vote among others.
When Pandemic began in March 2020, PAVA Advocates continued to ask for the reactivation of HAVA Advisory Committee and their subcommittees. Unfortunately, due COVID 19, the reactivation never occurred.  Despite that, PAVA advocates were creative and innovates, using media to educate disabled community. PAVA advocates had several meetings with 4 of the 5 political parties Electoral Commissioners.  At the beginning of fiscal year, SEC had only three officials’ political parties, the New Progressive Party (NPP) that have the majority in the Legislature and control the Executive branch, the minorities; Popular Democratic Party (PDP), and Independence Puerto Rican Party (IPP).  On February 2020, SEC approved the entry of two new political parties, The Citizen Victorious Movement (CVM) and Dignity Proyect (DP).  On March 2020, began Covid 19 Pandemia, that stopped the services in SEC until summer.  When we had the opportunity in June 2020, we communicate with SEC Presidency, to know the preparations for the Democratic Party Presidential Primaries. We meet Commissioner Sanchez, of the Democratic Party.  We began several telephone meetings with Commissioner Sanchez in order to have an accessible Primaries for disabled electors.  Commissioner Sanchez gave us the list of polling places for this Primaries.  On July 12, 2020 PAVA Advocates performed monitories in 3 polling places, where we don’t find accessibility issues, except the lack of Braille and Vote by Phone in order to compliance with HAVA section 301 (3b).
From July until September 2020, PAVA Director, had several telephones individual meetings with the Electoral Commissioners of the Active Political Parties, New Progressive Party (NPP), Democratic Popular Parties (DPP), Citizen Victorious Movement (CVM) and the Independence Puerto Rican Party (IPP). In the NPP, Commissioner change in three occasions, Juan Guzman until June 2020, Maria Santiago until august 2020, and at this time Commissioner Hector Sanchez. In the DPP, Commissioner change after Party Primaries in August, Lin Merle was the Commissioner until August and former SEC Vice President, Nicolas Gautier was named late in August as DPP Electoral Commissioner. In the IPP the Commissioner Roberto Aponte stay in his position all year, so we don’t need to reeducate him about HAVA Law.  In the case of the new political parties, the CVM, has the same Commissioner since the beginning in February, Orlin Valentin, we had several meetings to educate of HAVA provision. In the case of Dignity Proyect unfortunately, we tried to communicate with the Commissioner Edwardo Guzman, but it was infructuous.  Later we realizaed that he resigns, and the party named late in October a new Commissioner.
In each meeting our goal was to educate them as policy makers in order to achieves full compliance of HAVA and an electoral accessible process, where disabled can vote independently and with secrecy. 
Summarize of issues discussed with SEC Electoral Commissioners:
1. Analyze alternatives for compliance with accessible voting equipment’s, specifically Vote by Phone and Dominium Voting System used in previous elections.
2. Accessibility of the PIB´s including the open cases of Caguas, Rio Grande, Toa Baja and Morovis Towns, among others.
3. Follow up of the reactivation of the HAVA State Planning Committee or any other subcommittee like the Education and Training Committee, and our commitment to help with the participation of the disabled community
4. New Electoral Code approved in July 2020 and new alternatives like Vote by Mail 
5. Braille in each polling place
6. Vote by Phone to comply with HAVA section 301 (3b)
7. Advance Vote for persons with immune systems, like transplants patients, patients with cancer, AIDS or other diseases that can feel insecure due COVID 19.
8. Selecting Accessible Polling Places (at the end of fiscal year, September 30, 2020, SEC didn’t present the official list of polling places)
9. Vote at Home
10. Vote at Hospitals

With these Meetings we educate the main policy maker, the Commission, as a group can enforce the requested of accessibility in the elections process and HAVA Act. 
The performance measure of this objective are: Education and training of election officials, volunteers and poll workers regarding rights of people with disabilities and best practices, Registering people with disabilities to vote, Public and private places/services made more accessible and People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. With these Project we developed a strategy to educate the main policy maker, the Commission, as a group can enforce the requested of accessibility in the elections process and HAVA Act. PAVA advocates, updated the training for polling workers, including “Unit Coordinators”, and we were ready to train them. The elections officials (poll workers) in Puerto Rico, are designated by the political parties.  The problem of this situation is that these elections officials are voluntaries from the political parties. With current apathy to work for political parties, they have much difficulty to recruit volunteers.  So, the reality is that most of them are recruited just weeks before election.  As we established in the Priority, units’ coordinators are voluntaries of the political parties.  With the economic crisis the political parties don’t longer received governments funds to employ, so we just have voluntaries. If we add COVID 19 Pandemic, to all the reasons described above, unfortunately we we’re unable to perform the workshops.   
Meanwhile, PAVA advocates worked directly with the SEC officials, including the President giving them the information about the rights of persons with disabilities in the voting process. As we established above, we innovate, using media in historical proportions to impact disabled communities, polling workers, unit coordinators, registration officials and general public. As part of our Strategic Plan, PAVA advocates wanted to educate new voters. PAVA Advocates, jointed efforts with SEC Education and Training Office to educate high school students in special education programs.
PAVA advocates was ready to offer trainings with SEC officials to high school students with developmental and intellectual disabilities or other disabilities, about voting rights for disabled electors and information about the electoral process, but COVID 19 stopped it.
As part of our Strategic Plan, PAVA advocates wanted to educate new voters. PAVA Advocates, jointed efforts with SEC Education and Training Office to educate high school students of special education schools.
To empower high schools’ students and to encourage them to participate in the election process, PAVA advocates tried to offer trainings and workshops. Unfortunately, COVID 19 began in March 2020, we were ready to start the trainings in April, but we couldn’t do it.  To disseminate information as we established above, we use mass media efforts to impacts students and educate them about: registration process, special accommodations available for electors with disabilities, voting rights, among other, to educate them with self-advocacy tools. PAVA advocates updated the training for registration’s officials of the SEC.  The first one was held on November 19, 2020, where we impacted 15 SEC officials. We prepare to offer training to registration officials, then COVID 19 Pandemic, comes and paralyzed our efforts to trains them. As we established, PAVA advocates looked for innovate alternatives to train, including our one-hour Radio Program, Accessible Vote 2020, where we educated all sectors, disabled communities, poll workers and registration officials. 
Meanwhile, PAVA advocates worked directly with the SEC officials, including the President giving them the information about the rights of persons with disabilities in the voting process. As we established above, we innovate, using media in historical proportions to impact disabled communities, polling workers, unit coordinators, registration officials and general public.
PAVA advocated in each PIB's monitories (33 this fiscal year), with information to all election’s officials, about equal treatment of persons with intellectual developmental disabilities and persons with other disabilities, whose will participate in the electoral process.
This Projects contributes to reach our goal of an accessible election, guarantee the secretly and independence for electors with disabilities in all the process.  
With these Projects People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. In Puerto Rico, we don’t have any mid-term election, and we must wait for a special procedure, like Presidential Primaries (July 12, 2020) political parties’ primaries (August 2020) or the General Elections (November 2020). As we don’t had elections, electors with disabilities don’t opened complaints of voting rights.  

After a disaster in the Primaries, late in August we received one complaint about the lack of Braille templates and Vote by Phone option.  This case filled by a blind elector in Bayamon. The result of this case will be described in next fiscal year PPR.  Another case that we received, was about PIB Caguas accessibility.  This case was solved later in October, so it will be included in next PPR. The third and fourth case were about registration process, the first of a young 18-year-old lady with auto-immune disabilities and the second a 63-year-old male with orthopedics disabilities.  Due Covid 19, registration officials initially denied the registration process, fortunately, with PAVA advocacy, the electors completed the registration process, both cases will be reported next fiscal year. PAVA Advocates, offered 23 technical assistance to 23 individuals, including electors with disabilities and organizations mostly SEC officials. 
Technical Assistance Example:
A SEC electoral official requested PAVA, a copy of the 2010 ADA Accessibility Guidelines. She informed us that they are working with Corrective Actions Plan for Polling Places with physical barriers. PAVA advocates, not only provide the requested information, we explain the specific requirements of physical accessibility, including width door, accessible parking’s, and Accessible Voting College without steps in the entrance.
Most of the technical assistances provided by PAVA advocates, were to SEC staff, including SEC Presidency, Political Parties Commissioners, Advance and Absentee Board officials, Education and Training Officials and Press Release Officials.
PAVA advocates gave technical assistance in different issues:
1. Vote by Phone
2. Braille templates
3. Polling Place Accessibility
4. PIB Accessibility
5. PIB obligated to compliance with Act 297 of 2018 (express line for persons with disabilities)
6. Education and Training election officials
7. Advance and Absentee Vote for Electors with Disabilities, including new alternatives to deal with COVID Pandemic
8. Curb-side Voting
9. Vote by Mail
10. Vote in Hospital
11. Vote at Home

Technical assistances to SEC officials improve compliance with our Objective of having an accessible, secretly and independently electoral process. I/R Example:
A woman with orthopedics disabilities of Aguada County, contacts PAVA advocates, asking for alternatives to vote in Advance, for Parties Primaries of August 2020 and General Elections of November 2020. The client expressed that she had mobilities difficulty to move from her house and PAVA advocates, informed her about Advance Voting options including Vote at Home.  PAVA advocates, communicated with the Permanent Inscription Board of Aguada County and asked for help with this elector with disabilities.  PIB’s officials an PAVA advocates agree to help her with Vote at Home option, as an Advance Voting.  After local Party Primaries, the client call PAVA offices and report success in her voting alternative, she Voted at Home, thanks to PAVA provisions. 

This fiscal year we offered 36 information and referral services to individuals about their rights. The majority were received near the event Political Parties Primaries held on August 2020.  The Electors with disabilities asked information about the following topics:
1. Polling Places accessibilities
2. Registrations issues
3. Vote by Phone information
4. Advance and Absentee Voting 

The performance measure of this objective: People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process, People with disabilities receiving information, technical assistance and referral services. With each information distributed, persons with disabilities increase their knowledge in order to achieves been self-advocates. PAVA advocates performs 74 inspections in key dates to assure accessibility and compliance with HAVA provisions.

As part of our Strategic Plan for next election process, including Political Parties Primaries in June 2020 and the General Elections, November 2020, PAVA advocates seeks to select the better polling places.  PAVA Advocates, all years, selected a sample of previously used polling places and inspected them to verify their accessibility. These ocular inspections give us the opportunity to educate the facilities employees, about PAVA provisions and accessibility awareness. In each polling place inspected, PAVA’s advocates recommends to the persons in charge of the facility, an Accessible Voting Center with an accessible route. To be an Accessible Voting Center, it must have a reserved parking for persons with disabilities. This parking must be next to the accessible entrance of the polling place. All the paths must be full accessible, in order to give independence for voters with disabilities in the whole process. 
After each ocular inspection, if PAVA Advocates find any accessibility problem, we sent a writing report to SEC. In these reports for example, if PAVA advocates found a step in the entrance, we inform to SEC, so they can provide portable ramps.

The performance measure of this objective: Public and private places/services made more accessible. PAVA advocates, inspected surveying polling places to prevent any failure in the electoral process. If the polling place is not accessible at the date of the event, is very difficult to provide accessibility. As a preventive action, PAVA advocates performed 74 ocular inspections to polling places.  This preventive activity helps to determinate if the facility is the correct one for the election day, in terms of physical accessibility. If the polling place is accessible, electors with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. In each polling place inspections, PAVA advocates recommended an Accessible Voting Center. To be an Accessible Voting Center, it must have a reserved parking for persons with disabilities. This parking must be next to the accessible entrance of the polling place. All the paths must be full accessible, in order to give independence for voters with disabilities in the whole process. In the polling places where there are steps in the entrance, the SEC, will provide portable ramps recommended by PAVA advocates.

PAVA’s advocates recommended to SEC officials and to the persons in charge of the facility, the place to locate the Accessible Voting Center in an accessible route. On August during local Parties Primaries, we made monitories to polling places to verify accessibility, in three of the inspected polling places, Isaac Rosario School polling place in Cataño County and Rufino Vigo School, polling place in Humacao County, Rafael De Jesus School polling place in Rio Grande we found physical barriers in the Accessible Voting College (AVS). We found steps in the entrance, but the polling place had accessible options, so PAVA advocates recommends moving the AVC to a place without steps. We plan to monitor these polling places in next general elections in November 2020.

The performance measure of this objective: Public and private places/services made more accessible. PAVA advocates, inspected surveying polling places to prevent any failure in the electoral process. If the polling place is not accessible at the date of the event, is very difficult to provide accessibility. As a preventive action for General Elections, PAVA advocates performed 74 ocular inspections to polling places. This preventive activity helps to determinate if the facility is the correct one for the election day, in terms of physical accessibility. If the polling place is accessible, electors with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. The principal policy maker about any issue in the Elections Process is his President. The President is part of the Commission. The Electoral Commissioners with the SEC President are the Commission, responsible of establish public policy. PAVA advocates for disabled rights in each instance we had a meeting with any Commissioner and the President.
As PAVA advocates, we developed a personal communication with former President Davila to discussed and look for alternatives to comply with HAVA provisions. In reference to HAVA Law Section 301, 3 (b) that establishes the requirement of “use of at least one direct recording electronic voting system or other voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities at each polling place”, SEC President and PAVA Director have meeting on November 10, 2019 to look for alternatives besides Vote by Phone.  In the meeting we agreed the following:
1. Be opens to consider new options to compliance with Section 301 (3b)
2. We commit to investigate alternatives used in other states, compliance with our SGP.
3. The Commission and their Information System Office will help to study the alternatives.
4. We agree to have a follow up meeting in April.

Unfortunately, COVID 19 Pandemic and Government lockdown arrives, and we don’t have other option to reschedule until summer.  In summer, was too late, SEC had important electoral events, like the Democratic Party Presidential Primaries originally schedule for March, was moved to July and then the Political Parties Primaries, that were reschedule from June to August.
We don’t have other alternative; we decide to advocate for Vote by Phone in all the electoral events. From June thru August, we had several telephone communications with SEC President to achieve compliance with HAVA Section 301 (3b).  As we report above, unfortunately the crisis in SEC impacted Vote by Phone, and we don’t find it in the monitories held in August. 
On August 9, 2020, at the Political Parties Primaries, there was an historical crisis, where electors don’t receive the ballots in almost half of the island, and electors with disabilities do not had accessibility options, like Braille templates and Vote by Phone in the polling places. This forced a second part of Primaries, on August 16, 2020, where electors with disabilities do not have, again any accessibility option. On September 4, SEC President Judge Davila resigns.  Days later the Commission (Electoral Commissioners of the 5 active political parties) select Judge Rosado as President ad Judge Padilla as Alternative President in compliance with new Electoral Code (Act 58 of June 28, 2020).
We tried to have meetings with the new administration, this goal was met in October, it will be covered in next fiscal year PPR.
As a result of those meeting, the President committed to follow up the recommendations of PAVA, and to achieve accessibility in the next electoral process (2020) in compliance with HAVA Act.
The performance measure of this objective is: People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. With these Project we developed a strategy to educate the main policy maker, the President, who can enforce the requested of accessibility in the elections process and HAVA Act. As we established above, we could not evaluate the equipment, however, in meetings that we had with SEC President and the Electoral Commissioners, we advocate for compliance with HAVA Section 301 (3b). Due economic crisis and COVID 19 Pandemic, SEC select the cheaper and easier option, reusing the Vote by Phone alternative, with the existing special accommodations in accessible polling places. This option was not sponsored by disabled community with only a few electors using it in the past elections process, back in 2016. The Commission do not have any other alternative for disabled community that can attach to their limited budget due Overseas Fiscal Authority, also known as PROMESA ACT. When Senate Project 1314 converts in the new Electoral Code, Act 58 of June 28, 2020, the Code include Vote by Phone as the option to comply with Section 301 (3b), PAVA advocate for this inclusion, since the Project was release in Senate in 2019. Unfortunately, we don’t find the Vote by Phone option in the Presidential Democratic Party Primaries held in July, neither the local Parties Primaries on August 9 and 16, 2020.  PAVA Advocates do not have other option, to demand it in public, achieving it by mass media efforts to achieve Vote by Phone in the November 2020 General Elections. At the begin of fiscal year, PAVA advocates seek information of alternative equipment’s to compliance with Section 301 (3b) of HAVA.  In other States we discover the uses of several electronic equipment’s that complies with HAVA.  Unfortunately, when COVID 19 began in March 2020, SEC determinate to continue the use of Vote by Phone option. The determination was included in Senate Project 1314 that creates a new the Electoral Code.  Late in this fiscal year in June 28, 2020 the Act was signed, the new Electoral Code included Vote by Phone as the only option to comply with HAVA requirements.  After this, PAVA advocated for the compliance of having Vote by Phone in the electoral events.",,,,,
PR,2021,"PAVA advocates worked hard to solve the controversies in the electoral process. As part of the process PAVA had to ask for Court help to achieve accessibility for a blind elector of Bayamon Municipality. The case was filled by a blind elector in Bayamon that requested Braille as an option to vote in General Election.  After requesting an injunction in the court, PAVA client received Braille in his Polling Place in Bayamon.

Another case that we received, was about accessibility in PIB of Caguas Municipality.  This case was solved in October 2020 before General Election.  PIB in Caguas with the help of Caguas Municipality agree to use a nearest parking lot.  Also, as a special accommodation PAVA advocates agree with PIB staff to create a temporary space for disabled in front of the sidewalk of the location.  

The third case was about registration process of a young 18-year-old lady with problems in her immune system that denies her to move out of her house.  Due Covid 19, registration officials initially deny the registration process, fortunately, with PAVA advocate the elector register and vote.  After General Elections we confirmed that she can vote with Advance Vote Option (Vote by Mail).

The fourth case was about registration process of a disabled of 63-year-old with obesity problems.  He wanted to register to vote but he was unable to move to the Permanent Inscription Board (PIB) due obesity problems.  He asked PAVA assist to make the registration process.  After several procedures with Permanent Inscription Board (PIB), including calls, letters and meetings, PIB officials agree to register with his Real ID, that was also a result of PAVA advocate’s help.  With PAVA advocacy the client can cast his vote independently in Early Voting mode, Vote at Home. Most of the technical assistance provided by PAVA advocates, were to SEC staff, including SEC Presidency, Political Parties Commissioners, Advance and Absentee Board officials, Education and Training Officials and Press Release Officials.
PAVA advocates gave technical assistance in different issues:
1. Vote by Phone
2. Braille templates
3. Polling Place Accessibility
4. PIB Accessibility
5. PIB obligated to compliance with Act 297 of 2018 (express line for persons with disabilities)
6. Education and Training election officials
7. Advance and Absentee Vote for Electors with Disabilities, including new alternatives to deal with COVID Pandemic
8. Curb-side Voting
9. Vote by Mail
10. Vote in Hospital
11. Vote at Home
Technical assistances to SEC officials improve compliance with our Objective of having an accessible, secretly and independently electoral process. This fiscal year we offered information and referral services to 94 individuals with disabilities to individuals about their rights. The majority we’re received near the General Election held on November and the Special Election called Act to Create a Congressional Delegation of Puerto Rico held on May 16, 2021.  Electors with disabilities ask information about the following topics:
1. Polling Places accessibilities
2. Registrations issues
3. Vote by Phone information
4. Advance and Absentee Voting 

On October 31, 2020, PAVA Advocates, create a hot line (787) 945-2116 to provide last minute information for disabled electors prior General Elections. As a results of this effort PAVA Advocates gave I/R services to 65 individuals. The majority ask information of:
1. Polling Places location
2. Advance Vote complaints like, that the Vote by Mail did not arrive,
3. Complaints of Vote at Home, that the officials did not arrive to collect the vote
4. Information about advance vote in polling places (October 31, 2021) for certain persons including persons with disabilities
5. Long lines
6. Failure in electronic voting equipment’s


Example of I/R
On September 29, 2020, a client with disabilities call Puerto Rico P&A, to ask for information about Vote in Hospitals.  She was worried, because she was in the hospital and wants to cast her vote.  PAVA Advocates oriented her about Early Voting Options including Vote in Hospitals.  If she stays in the hospital in General Election, she needs to ask the service to the nurse and polling workers will complete the process.  If she is out of the Hospital but have problems to arrives to her assigned polling place, she can ask for Early Voting option of Vote at Home or Vote by Mail.  With all the information needed, the voter can decide the option of early voting in the next Election Process.

The performance measure of this objective: People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process, People with disabilities receiving information, technical assistance and referral services. With each information distributed, persons with disabilities increase their knowledge to achieves self-advocates.

* Underserved/Unserved/Minorities Targeted? -Yes, we impact underserved minorities with some I/R services provides to individuals with disabilities, which know us by the Radio Program, media efforts and the implementation of a hot line. As part of our Strategic Plan for the main election process, the General Elections, held in November 2020, PAVA advocates seek to have accessible polling places.  PAVA Advocates, in Election year, selected a sample of polling places and inspected them to verify their accessibility and compliance with HAVA.  In each monitory we can check physical accessibility, and the compliance of Section 301-3-b of HAVA, in Puerto Rico Vote by Phone equipment. These ocular inspections give us also the opportunity to educate the facilities employees, about PAVA provisions and accessibility awareness. In each polling place inspected, PAVA’s advocates recommends to the persons in charge of the facility, an Accessible Voting Center with an accessible route. To be an Accessible Voting Center, it must have a reserved parking for persons with disabilities. This parking must be next to the accessible entrance of the polling place. All the paths must be full accessible, in order to give independence for voters with disabilities in the whole process. 
After each ocular inspection, if PAVA Advocates find any accessibility problem, we sent a writing report to SEC. In these reports for example, if PAVA advocates found a step in the entrance, we inform to SEC, so they can provide portable ramps.

The performance measure of this objective: Public and private places/services made more accessible. PAVA inspected surveying polling places to monitor any failure in the electoral process. In General Election and the Special election on May 2021, PAVA advocates performed 69 ocular inspections to polling places.  This activity helps to determinate if the facility is the correct one for next election process, in terms of physical accessibility. If the polling place is accessible, electors with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process.

PAVA Advocates performs 69 inspections to 69 polling places across Puerto Rico.  The purpose was to verify accessibility in the polling places and verify the availability of Vote by Phone equipment as an alternative to comply with HAVA Section 301-3-b.  Unfortunately, of the 69 polling places, just two of them have Vote by Phone equipment, properly installed and ready for use.  PAVA Advocates helps polling workers in the other 67 polling places to install the Vote by Phone equipment’s.  This finding was mentioned to SEC Presidency, and we ask for solutions, in June 2021 meeting with SEC President.  The President establish that the problem was that political parties don’t educate their polling workers.  PAVA have been available for political parties to help them in education efforts toward polling workers.

*Underserved/Unserved/Minorities Targeted? X Yes,
In each monitory we impacted underserved communities, all voters of the polling place are impact by this objective. The Permanent Inscriptions Boards (PIB’s) are the place where the voters go to make all the registration process.  This is the place where persons with disabilities come to request accessible voting, in the Accessible Voting College (AVC). For this reason, it should be accessible of any physical barrier. 
After the economic crisis in PR, to reduce budget expenses, SEC established a plan to reduce the number of PIB’s.  Some of the PIB’s were consolidated, others are moving to state facilities.  In FY 2020 PAVA Advocates inspected 15 Permanent Inscriptions Boards (PIB’s), before November General Elections. On October 2020, PAVA Advocates inspected 3 additional locations in Caguas, Arecibo and Toa Baja Municipalities in order to eliminate the any physical barrier.  PIB´s are the physical locations to register to vote. In each Permanent Inscription Board visited, we orientated inscription officials about accessibility and equal treatment of persons with disabilities in the electoral environment.  
The performance measure of this objective: Registering people with disabilities to vote, Public and private places/services made more accessible and People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. If each PIB´s is accessible, persons with disabilities will have the opportunity to register in the election and further participates in the electoral process. With these Projects People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process.

*Underserved/Unserved/Minorities Targeted? X Yes    
The PIB´s serves all the voters with disabilities, including persons with disabilities with lower poverty levels.  These persons need to make the registration process, to ask for the Accessible Voting Center, and to cast their vote in the polling place.

**Total estimated number of electors with disabilities possible impacted by this Objective: 23,095. Registering people with disabilities to vote.
1. Electors who voted in November General Elections in Caguas Municipality: 47,081 * 0.216 (21.6%) = 10,170
     Estimated electors with disabilities in Caguas – 10,170
2.  Electors who voted in in November General Elections in Toa Baja Municipality: 26,624  * 0.216 (21.6%) = 5,751
     Estimated electors with disabilities in Toa Baja – 5,751

     Estimated electors with disabilities in Arecibo – 7,174

*21.6% of persons with disabilities according to the Census 2019 estimates. As we established in the objective, compliance depends on the SEC, if it selected the new Integrated Service Centers. At the time of writing this report, the only one that was named as the Integrated Services Center is in Las Marías Municipality located in the central region of Puerto Rico. We don't know if this one will continue to be part of the new Integrated Services Center according to the relocation process expressed in the New Electoral Law of 2020. Despite that, we inspect it and verify that this facility meets the accessibility requirements for voters with disabilities. Because we had concerns about the location of these new Integrated Service Centers, during the fiscal year after the General Election, PAVA held several meetings with SEC officials to inquire about those Integrated Service Centers. We were told that the Commission is working hard to comply with the order of the law, of having selected before the summer of 2022. We expect the facilities to be selected by the summer of 2022, and the goal will be rescheduled for the next fiscal year.

*Underserved/Unserved/Minorities Targeted? X Yes -In each monitory we served underserved minorities, all Integrated Services Center served all electors. Due the COVID 19 Pandemic PAVA, had to innovate to educate our main target, electors with disabilities, and polling workers.  On August 19, 2020, PAVA begins a radio program named Accessible Vote 2020 that was aired in WIPR 940AM all Wednesday at 2pm thru 3pm until General Elections. All media efforts will be described in 3.3 Objective.

On October 29, 2021, PAVA Coordinator offered an Electoral Accessibility workshop to 6 professionals and volunteer staff and support from the Institute for Development Deficiencies, including relatives of voters with disabilities. In it, we discuss issues such as the HAVA Law, the PAVA Program, self-advocacy skills for electoral matters, electoral accessibility, among others. The evaluation of the workshop was excellent and questions about accessibility in the electoral process were answered.

On March 26, 2021, PAVA Advocates offers a training to nine (9) members of one of the biggest NGO in Puerto Rico who works directly with persons with developmental and intellectual disabilities, “Asociación Mayagüezana de Personas con Impedimentos”.  Another training was offered by PAVA Advocates to 17 NUC University professionals.  This kind of trainings gave information of PAVA provisions including special accommodations and early voting options for electors with disabilities.  

The performance measure of this objective: People with disabilities trained to become active participants in making decisions that affect their lives, Education and training of people with disabilities on their voting rights.
Despite the purposes of this priority is to educate persons with disabilities, we include general public, and who´s can spread the information among family or relatives with disabilities. In each training and outreach efforts, PAVA advocates promote the existing accessibility tools available in the electoral process.

Meanwhile, PAVA advocates worked directly with the SEC officials, including the President giving them the information about the rights of persons with disabilities in the voting process. As we established above, we innovate, using media in historical proportions to impact disabled communities, polling workers, unit coordinators, registration officials and general public.
This Projects contributes to reach our goal of an accessible election, guarantee the secretly and independence for electors with disabilities in all the process.  

With these Projects People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. PAVA advocates were ready to offer trainings with SEC officials to high school students with developmental and intellectual disabilities or other disabilities, about voting rights for disabled electors and information about the electoral process, but COVID 19 stop it.
As part of our Strategic Plan, PAVA advocates want to target new voters. PAVA Advocates, jointed efforts with SEC Education and Training Office to educate high school students at special education schools.
To empower high schools’ students and to encourage them to participate in the election process, PAVA advocates try to offer trainings and workshops. Unfortunately, COVID 19 begins in March 2020, we we’re ready to start the trainings in April, but we can’t do it.  To disseminate information as we established above, we use media efforts to impacts students and educate them about: registration process, special accommodations available for electors with disabilities, voting rights, among other, to educate them with self-advocacy tools.

Example of news release with quotes of PAVA Coordinator related with Early Voting in Polling Places:

PAVA denounce lack of access to Vote by Telephone and shortage of ballots in Braille

PAVA’s Director, Gabriel Esterrich, denounced the breach of SEC on Saturday Early Voting, after monitoring the polling stations of the following municipalities of San Juan, Trujillo Alto, Sabana Grande, Isabela, Aguada, Moca and Las Piedras. In these monitoring it was evidenced that in the early voting colleges the installation of the Vote by Phone equipment was not found, neither template in Braille for blind electors.

“Only the magnifying glass was shown, and when requested. We have also observed accessibility issues, as well as a lack of accessible parking and voting locations. We are reporting this breach of the State Elections Commission (SEC) with the federal law 'Help America Vote Act', and we are informing the media so that people with disabilities can claim their rights”,
""Tuesday's process has to be accessible to all citizens and our mission is to scrupulously comply with state and federal laws and regulations.""
PAVA Coordinator, Gabriel Esterrich, reported the need to comply with the 'Help America Voting Act' of 2002.

""This Act provides for accessible, secret and independent voting for voters with disabilities. There is no room for mistakes, the process must be fully accessible for voters with disabilities,"" said Esterrich.
In the follow-up carried out in the primaries last August by our staff, ""the lack of the 'Vote by Phone' system was found, which is of great importance in the process."" We confirmed that they sent the briefcase with the equipment to the Permanent Registration Boards (PIB's), when it should have been sent to the electoral colleges”, said Esterrich.

Last Minute Outreach for General Elections:

On October 27, 2020, PAVA Coordinator sent a press release to general media to announce the practice of Vote by Phone.  This practice encourages electors to participate in the process using this special accommodation in compliance with HAVA.

On October 31, 2020, PAVA Advocates performed monitories to Polling Places in the Early Voting Event, PAVA Coordinator denounced the lack of compliance of HAVA; in all polling places samples advocates don’t find Vote by Phone option for disabled community. 

In social media like Facebook, all TV, radio and written press reports were copied to add outreach of PAVA efforts.
Example of Facebook outreach efforts:

On March 25, 2021, PAVA Legal Advisor sent a promotion on the Advance Vote deadline of March 27, 2021, for the May 16 presidential delegation event. It was disclosed on the agency's social networks including Facebook. This type of promotion is important so that voters with disabilities have the information of deadlines and can vote and report if they need any accommodation to vote.

We also have a web page www.dpi.pr.gov where we have information about PAVA and had 19,644 hits this fiscal year. As we established above due COVID 19, PAVA advocates, used media instead of services fairs and paper brochures used in previous years, to disseminate the information.  In each outreach efforts, PAVA advocates explained the importance of giving the specials accommodations to persons with intellectual developmental disabilities and persons with other disabilities in the electoral process, PAVA provisions, HAVA and ADA Act, among other information to developed self-advocacy skills.
The purpose of the different interventions in the media is to educate future voters about: 
1. Rights of persons with disabilities, 
2. The voting process, 
3. The accessibility of the polling places and the AVC
4. The alternative Vote at Home, where a designated Board representing the political parties let persons with mobility disabilities cast the vote in their home, dates before the Election Day
5. The alternative Vote in Hospital, where SEC designated a Board representing the political parties let people hospitalized cast their vote in the hospital’s room.
6. The alternative of Vote by Phone System.
The performance measure of this objective: Education and training of people with disabilities on their voting rights. The importance of this priority is to educate general public, who´s can spread the information among family or relatives with disabilities.
This objective impacts all electors with disabilities. When you used almost all the media in several times, some of them in prime time, you can estimate that all electors with disabilities receive the information. The estimate based in the Census 2019 is 21.6%, Electors that vote in General Elections 2020 was 1,284,630 * 0.216% = 277,480 PAVA Advocates performs 7 workshops to improve transportation services to disabled electors that need transportations services for registration and voting.

As part of efforts to engage candidates, PAVA Defenders conducted several phone calls and online meetings with candidate staff. The communications were made on October 6, 7, 8, 16 and 20. The result was the participation of Eliezer Molina, an independent candidate in our Radio Program.

2. On October 13, 2020, PAVA advocates and legal staff had a virtual meeting with the SEC President and the alternate President to seek solutions for blind voters, one of whom requested Braille templates as a special adaptation.

4. Informative Fair at State Council of Rehabilitation The number of individuals with disabilities impacted was 41. As 2023 wasn’t an electoral year, PAVA worked other advocacy efforts to improve accessibility in the electoral process.
1. Permanent Inscription Board Maunabo –PAVA Advocates receive information of the movement of this PIB so before moving it on March 28, 2023, PAVA made an ocular inspection and recommends moving this to another facility due to accessibility problems.  Number impacted 8,871.
2. Meeting with New Progressive Party Electoral Commissioner – On May 24, 2023, PAVA Advocates, as part of Educating Policy Makers efforts, had a meeting with the Electoral Commissioner of the New Progressive Party.  In this meeting we discussed the importance of accessible polling places and the requirement of HAVA on this matter. Also, PAVA Advocates emphasized the education of polling workers, and we inform that we’re available to give the training. Regarding the selection of schools and Accessible Voting College classrooms to be used, it was emphasized that Local Commissioners must use the checklist that the State Elections Commission has and that the PAVA Advocates reviewed to ensure that the facility selected as a voting center and the Accessible Voting College does not have any physical barriers. In this way, the facility to be used as a voting center is adequately evaluated. On the other hand, the Commissioner reported that when the election year begins, they will begin to provide training to the Local Commissioners and in turn to the people who will serve as polling workers. That is when the PAVA Advocates can be integrated to talk about the treatment of people with disabilities and emphasize the different accommodations that exist for voters with disabilities.  This group case impacted all electors with disabilities of this political party 92,234. For ONE PPR, the impacted number will be 1, the Electoral Commissioner. 
3.    Radio Victoria 840 Accessible Electoral Process Program – On August 8, 2023, PAVA Advocates participated in a Radio Program at Radio Victoria 840AM where we discussed all information regarding accessible election process, the new Electoral Law, HAVA provisions, and special accommodations for electors with disabilities including Vote at Home, Vote by Mail, Early Voting in Polling Places, Accessible Polling Places, comply of HAVA 301 3b among other issues.  The approximate number of people hearing this radio Program is 10,000, using the 21.6% estimated of people with disabilities we impacted 2,160.
4. Informative Fair at State Council of Rehabilitation. On September 8, 2023, PAVA Advocates participated in a Services Fair of the State Rehabilitation Council in Fundación Luis Muñoz Marín located in Trujillo Alto Municipality (metropolitan area) where we impacted PAVA with information to 41 participants.
5. New Northeast Integrated Services Center Ceiba Municipality PAVA Advocates receive information of SEC about the new Integrated Services Center in the Northeast area (where electors can made registration process in this geographical area) that will be in Ceiba Municipality in Roosevelt Roads area.  PAVA Advocates performed ocular inspection and gave recommendations to building employees and to SEC officials; in this fiscal year we observed progress but is not complete.  We hope this 2024 fiscal year SEC finishes with this registration center who benefit people with disabilities of the northeast region. The approximate number of people with disabilities impacted is 9,032. Most of the technical assistance provided by PAVA advocates was to polling workers and SEC staff.
1. PAVA advocates gave technical assistance of polling place Accessibility, including the importance of accessible booths.
Technical assistances to SEC officials improve compliance with our Objective of having an accessible, secretly, and independently electoral process.
2023-08-2309661
On August 4, 2023, PAVA advocates receive a call from Juan S. Rios, Director of the SEC Geoelectoral Planning Office. He is interested in being provided with information on the dimensions required for voting booths accessible to voters with disabilities. PAVA advocates searched for the dimensions required by law, and we sent them to you by email. In this communication, we inform you of our relationship with the SEC that dates to 2004 when the HAVA Program began to be part of the Broad Committee of the SEC and has worked hand in hand with the SEC to develop new accommodations and guarantee the right to vote. of people with disabilities. Regarding the issue of voting booths, we inform you what the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) explains, which establishes that the accessible route for people with disabilities must measure at least 36 inches wide. This is why, given the circumstances of the different mobility equipment used by the population with disabilities, we recommend that the width of the booth be 36 inches. However, knowing that the free space of an access route includes movement through doors, and these require a minimum of 32 inches wide, booths for people with disabilities could have at least 32 inches wide free space. On the other hand, the surface where the person is going to place the ballot to exercise their right to vote must be 34 inches high.
With this technical assistance to an SEC Official, they have the requirements for accessible booths, so that when they buy them for the next elections, they do so in compliance. As we’re not in Election year we don’t receive more I/R services requested, but in every monitory performed by a PAVA advocate we gave information to disabled voters who participated in the process.

2023-12-2267108

On December 19, 2022, a client with specific learning disabilities called us requesting help to obtain a duplicate of her electoral ID to have identification and be able to carry out various procedures. In the call we oriented the client about our PAVA Program, the accommodations in the electoral scenario and the provisions of the HAVA Law.
Then PAVA Advocates contacts our SEC liaisons, specifically the Office of Education and Training, and the voter registration officers so that they could communicate with the client and assist her in this process. Once our management was completed, the client was offered information with self-defense and empowerment tools. The client then had his electoral card, thanks to the guidance of PAVA staff. As part of our Strategic Plan PAVA advocates seek to have accessible polling places.  In each monitory (ocular inspection) we can check physical accessibility and give technical assistance to polling workers and information services to electors with disabilities. These ocular inspections also give us the opportunity to educate the facilities employees about PAVA provisions and accessibility awareness. In each polling place inspected, PAVA’s advocates recommends to the persons in charge of the facility, an Accessible Voting Center with an accessible route. To be an Accessible Voting Center, it must have a reserved parking for persons with disabilities. This parking must be next to the accessible entrance of the polling place. All the paths must be fully accessible, to give independence to voters with disabilities in the whole process. 

After each ocular inspection, if PAVA Advocates find any accessibility problem, we send a writing report to SEC. In these reports for example, if PAVA advocates found a step in the entrance, we inform SEC, so they can provide portable ramps. 

Polling Places visited in the fiscal year 2023 by PAVA Advocates:

1. Polling Place Mario Morales Coliseum – Guaynabo Municipality
On March 23, 2023, PAVA advocates performed an ocular inspection of this polling place. In this, we found problems at some of the access entrances. In past electoral events, the back part of the Coliseum was used as the entrance to the center. This entrance is not accessible, due to the slope of the ramp and the lack of handrails. They informed us that they used this area in the last electoral event because of the sun. During the inspection we observed problems in the parking lot; specifically, the labeling and measurements required.
In a written communication, we recommend to the President of the SEC to guide the polling workers of this center to locate the accessible entrance for people with disabilities in the front of the Coliseum, where they can in turn locate with the help of the police, for the electoral event, a provisional reserved parking lot with the sign provided by the Commission, in the unit's briefcase. The SEC in subsequent communications informed us that they will accept our recommendations. PAVA advocates will be very vigilant in complying with accessibility in this voting center. The approximate number of voters with disabilities impacted is 95. This number, like all voting centers, is 21.6%, who according to the 2020 Census are people with disabilities multiplied by the electoral participation in the center in the last electoral event.

2. Polling Place Luz America Calderon School – Carolina Municipality. 
On November 30, 2022, PAVA Advocates reinspect this polling place. In the ocular inspection PAVA found problems of accessibility in the parking lot, specifically the lack of vans accessible parking. After the inspection, PAVA Advocates established communication with SEC Presidency and recommended them to guide the polling workers of this polling place of this school to be aware of this matter and to temporarily and provisionally locate a parking lot reserved for vans with the label provided by the Commission, in the unit's briefcase. It is recommended to place it in the main entrance area, the closest to the Easy Access School. As in all inspections, in subsequent communications with the SEC they informed us that they will accept our recommendations. PAVA advocates will be very vigilant in complying with accessibility in this voting center. The approximate number of voters with disabilities impacted is 365.
3. El Señorial School - San Juan Municipality. 
On August 24, 2023, PAVA Advocates reinspect this polling place.  This school in San Juan have a parking lot inside the school, but these parking’s have issues about signage and measures that can affect electors with disabilities accessibility.  
Besides that, the designated Accessible Voting College, where it should be located the Easy Access College for electors with disabilities had a step of inch height in the entrance door.  PAVA Advocates sent a report to SEC Presidency and SEC officials of the Planning Office where we recommend that in every next electoral the disabled parking should be located near the school main entrance with the label provided by the Commission, in the unit's briefcase. In terms of the step of 1 inch height at the entrance door of the Accessible Voting College we recommend SEC to provide a portable ramp for next electoral process held in this polling place.
As in all inspections, in subsequent communications with the SEC they informed us that they will accept our recommendations. PAVA advocates will be very vigilant in complying with accessibility in this voting center. The approximate number of voters with disabilities impacted is 10.

On September 2023, PAVA Advocates sent a year final report where we recommend to SEC Presidency and SEC officials the possible solutions of accessibility issues of the polling places group cases.

PAVA Advocates performed 3 inspections at 3 polling places across Puerto Rico.  The purpose was to verify accessibility in the polling places.  All of them have some Accessibility problems. The total number of people with disabilities impacted by this objective is 465.
The performance measure of this objective: Public and private places/services made more accessible. This activity helps to determine if the facility is the correct one for the next election process, in terms of physical accessibility. If the polling place is accessible, electors with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. The Permanents Inscription Board (PIB) are the old location to do registration process. Integrated Services Centers are the new places where the voters go to do all the registration process.  This is the place where persons with disabilities come to request accessible voting, in the Accessible Voting College (AVC). For this reason, it should be accessible of any physical barrier. By the end of 2023 fiscal year there are Integrated Services Centers and some Permanent Inscription Board, that will remain open until the New Integrated Services Center is set and ready to receive electors.
After the economic crisis in PR, to reduce budget expenses, and after the approval of the New Electoral Code of 2020 in Puerto Rico, SEC established to close Permanent Inscriptions Boards and create the new Integrated Service Center in 12 regions across Puerto Rico.  Some PIB’s were closed, and others will remain open, until the Integrated Services Center are designated.  Last fiscal year we reported the one that was ready, located in Caguas Municipality and will cover the central area. This year SEC communicated with PAVA advocates about the location of another Integrated Services Center.  
1. One of the Integrated Services that was inspected this year is in Ceiba.  This is the second one (last year we worked with Caguas) of twelve relocated to a new facility.  PAVA Advocates and SEC agreed to do ocular inspection to this new location to achieve accessibility in this registration center location. The New Integrated Services Center is in Ceiba Municipality in the Northeast area (where electors can made registration process in this geographical area) in Roosevelt Roads area.  PAVA Advocates performed ocular inspection and gave recommendations to building employees and to SEC officials. In this fiscal year we observed progress in accessibility matters of this location, but there're not finished.  We hope, next 2024 fiscal year SEC finishes with this registration center who benefits people with disabilities of the northeast region, specifically the municipalities of Ceiba, Luquillo, Río Grande, Fajardo, and the Islands of Vieques and Culebra. The approximate number of people with disabilities impacted is 9,032.
2. Permanent Inscription Board Maunabo –PAVA Advocates received information of the relocation of this PIB so before moving it on March 28, 2023, PAVA made an ocular inspection and recommended moving this to another facility due to accessibility problems.  Number impacted 8,871. This Permanent Inscription Board in Maunabo Municipality will be relocated to Humacao Municipality as an Integrated Services Center of east area that will cover the Municipalities of Humacao, Las Piedras, Yabucoa, Naguabo and Maunabo.

This Permanent Registration Board was verified, as part of the change to the new Electoral Code of Puerto Rico (Law No. 58 of June 20, 2020), which establishes the change in the form of the electoral registry. In this Law in its Article 4.6, the Permanent Registration Boards will be consolidated in twelve regions and will be named as Integrated Services Center. Through Resolution CEE-RS-21-038, regional offices were established by taking into consideration the population density and road geography of Puerto Rico. The Integrated Services Center will be in the following municipalities: Aguadilla, Aibonito, Arecibo, Bayamón, Caguas, Ceiba, Guayama, Humacao, Mayagüez, Ponce, San Juan and Utuado. However, voters can visit any Integrated Services Center of their convenience on the Island.
The total number of people with disabilities impacted is 17,903.  Maunabo 8,871 + Ceiba 9,032 + = 17,903

The performance measure of this objective: Registering people with disabilities to vote, Public and private places/services made more accessible and People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. If each PIB´s and Integrated Service Center is accessible, persons with disabilities will have the opportunity to register in the election and further participates in the electoral process. With these Projects People with disabilities are better able to participate fully in the electoral process. In a non-electoral year, (without any special elections like 2021,2022) PAVA, had to innovate to educate our main target, electors with disabilities, and polling workers.  PAVA participated in several Radio and TV Programs, digital newspapers, and social media:

In terms of paper brochures, we disseminated 214 in the services fairs where PAVA participated during the fiscal year.
These media efforts contribute to reach our goal of an accessible election, guarantee the secret and independence for all electors with disabilities in all the process.  

The purpose of the different interventions in the media is to educate future voters, polling workers, SEC officials and general public about: 
1. Rights of persons with disabilities, 
2. The voting process, 
The accessibility of the polling places and the Accessible Voting College,
4. The alternative of Vote by Mail, where electors request this early voting, receiving the ballots by mail and returning by mail to SEC,
5. The alternative Vote at Home, where a designated Board representing the political parties let persons with mobility disabilities cast the vote in their home, dates before the Election Day,
6. The alternative Vote in Hospital, where SEC designated a Board representing the political parties let people hospitalized cast their vote in the hospital’s room,
7. The alternative of Vote by Phone System.

The performance measure of this objective: Education and training of people with disabilities on their voting rights. The importance of this priority is to educate general public, who´s can spread the information among family or relatives with disabilities.

The purpose of the different interventions in the media is to achieve an accessible electoral process impacting all electors with disabilities 277,480.  The 277,489 estimate is the result of: Electors that vote in General Elections 2020 1,284,630 * 0.216% = 277,480.  The 21.6% is the estimate provided in 2019 American Community Survey Estimates Subject Tables Disability Characteristics Survey/Program: American Community Survey Table ID: S1810

Last fiscal year PAVA advocates began a joint effort with SABE (Self Advocates Becoming Empowered) organization to work specifically in GoVoter Project.  
Late in August 2022, PAVA identified 10 leaders of the disabled community to give then the GoVoter training, so them can replicate the training next fiscal year. The training initially was scheduled for September 23, 2022, but unfortunately, Huracan Fiona hit Puerto Rico and we reschedule it for October 2022, obviously some of the advocates confirmed for this training for the change of date, couldn’t participate.  So, in less than a week PAVA Advocates recruited other advocates to the rescheduled date.
On October 13, 2022, PAVA Advocates with the help of SABE officials gave the first GoVoter Training in Puerto Rico, joining the other 37 P&A in this unique Project.

The training was held in our Central Office Conference room on October 13, 2022, from 8:00 AM through 5:00 PM to 10 leaders for the disabled community in Puerto Rico, 9 of them arrived at the Office and the 10th participant joined the training using the digital alternative of Microsoft Teams.  This training consists of the presentation created by SABE officials, that was previously translated to Spanish by PAVA advocate. The training was highly coverage by media, including live presentation of two TV station WIPR Channel 6 and TeleOro Channel 13. In both live presentations some of the advocates express their complete satisfaction with the training and compromise with enthusiastic commitment to further GoVoter Activities.  Also, we promoted PAVA and accessibility in the electoral process.  The media results were included in the previous objective. As we established in SGP 2023, SEC Committee and Sub-committees are activated by SEC.  Unfortunately, the SEC Presidency had administrative changes, including the change in the President position.  For several political issues, the Puerto Rico Government don’t renew the former President to another term and this change in the Presidency affected the work of such committees.  SEC doesn’t activate the Committee nor Sub-committees this year.  
Despite that, PAVA continued effective communication with SEC officials.  In the first goal of this PPR we report our results that were achieved due our closely work with SEC officials: 
1. Objective 1.1 - Where we reported our achievements with group cases closed.
2. Objective 1.2 - Where we reported our achievements with 5 open group cases, four of them were closed thanks to great communication with SEC officials.
3. Objective 1.3 - Where we described technical assistance to SEC officials specifically about the voting booths for electors with disabilities. 

The main activity that also compliance with this objective was the Meeting with New Progressive Party Electoral Commissioner – On May 24, 2023, PAVA Advocates as part of Educating Policy Makers efforts, have a meeting with the Electoral Commissioner of the New Progressive Party.  In this meeting we discussed the importance of accessible polling places and the requirement of HAVA on this matter. Also, PAVA Advocates emphasized the education of polling workers, and we inform that we’re available to give the training. Regarding the selection of schools and Accessible Voting College classrooms to be used, it was emphasized that Local Commissioners must use the checklist that the State Elections Commission has and that the PAVA Advocates reviewed to ensure that the facility selected as a voting center and the Accessible Voting College does not have any physical barriers. In this way, the facility to be used as a voting center is adequately evaluated. On the other hand, the Commissioner reported that when the election year begins, they will begin to provide training to the Local Commissioners and in turn to the people who will serve as polling workers. That is when the PAVA Advocates can be integrated to talk about the treatment of people with disabilities and emphasize the different accommodations that exist for voters with disabilities. 
This objective impacts all electors with disabilities. When you educate policy makers and SEC officials including several communications with SEC Presidency, you can estimate that all electors with disabilities receive the information. The estimate based in the Census 2019 is 21.6%, Electors that vote in General Elections 2020 was 1,284,630 * 0.216% = 277,480.  Of the 277,480, 33.24% in the last General Elections 2020 vote for the New Progressive Party, you can estimate 92,234 persons with disabilities. PAVA Program Manager in collaboration with PAVA advocates, prepared an SGP draft with a data driven strategic plan of:
• Staff experience – PAVA Director has been working with the Program since the start of PAVA in Puerto Rico, 2004.  The other employees have experienced of several year working in these matters.
• Monitories and investigations of accessibility in Polling places and Permanent Inscription Board (PIB´s) or Integrated Services Center. Knowing the reality of inaccessibility in Puerto Rico, PAVA realizes the importance of making monitories and investigations to assure accessibility. In case the selected locations by SEC are inaccessible, we report it so they can select accessible places.
• PAVA Program Manager made research, comparing PAVA SGP draft with other P&A’s to produce a SGP that meets with P&A standards.
• Public Comments – PAVA spread the PAVA SGP FY 2023 for public comments by internet and emails blast. Then after receiving this input, PAVA adopted some of these recommendations and finalized the SGP.
• Collaboration with other Programs of the Protection and Advocacy System of Puerto Rico – PAVA share information with other programs and establish joint efforts to achieve an accessible electoral process.
• Public Hearing – On September 29, 2023, PAVA Advocates lead a public hearing by Microsoft Teams.

RI,2023,"Rhode Island law requires that all mail ballots be received by the Board of Elections by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day. This hard deadline means that if a mail ballot is sent by mail before Election Day and post marked before Election Day but the arrives after Election Day, the ballot will not be counted. In previous fiscal years, DRRI and its community partners advocated for the State to provide temporary drop box receptacles at every polling place. In FY2023, the Board of Elections continued this practice which makes casting a ballot easier for voters with disabilities in the last days leading up to Election Day. 

Prior to 2022, the Rhode Island mail ballot process required all mail ballot applicants to submit an an original signed application for a mail ballot with no option to submit an application via facsimile, email or on-line portal. Over years of PAVA advocacy work, DRRI encountered a number of voters who were disenfranchised by this requirement. DRRI identified the requirement to election policy makers as restrictive and a barrier to voting for people with disabilities. Following education by DRRI and advocacy by community partners, RI passed comprehensive election reform legislation called the Let RI Vote Act in 2022. The new law allowed for the creation of an on-line option for submitting a mail ballot application, eliminated a notary-witness requirement and made other changes to increase voter participation and election security. In FY2023, the State commenced use of an on-line portal that enables RI voters with disabilities who have a state ID issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles to apply for a mail ballot application on-line. This change in practice potentially impacts all people with disabilities who have a State issued ID by making electoral participation easier. The number is approximately 235,800 people. In FY2023, DRRI operated a year-round voter hotline to assist voters to register to vote; ascertain their voter registration status; learn about the ways to vote, technologies available and voting rights; and to respond to rights violations. DRRI conducted outreach about our hotline and voting services via RI’s Public Transit system (RIPTA), RI Public Radio, a free magazine with broad distribution and at trainings and community events. The RIPTA outreach program included large signs on the sides of 12 king buses that passed through 90% of the State especially in underserved communities. DRRI’s hotline was publicized on the Secretary of State’s website and Voter Guide that was mailed to 400,000 households, and in voter’s rights pamphlets distributed by the RI ACLU and Common Cause. The radio and free magazine campaign ran for the General Election in November and for a Special Congressional Election in the fall of 2023. This outreach work was targeted at reaching diverse populations. We estimate that this information and referral outreach potentially reached approximately 225,120 people with disabilities and is reported in the Overview of People Served by PAVA at Section B.3. The 8 calls we received were treated as service requests and will be discussed with PAVA priority 5. DRRI provided technical assistance and substantive content about voting rights and accessible voting features for the Secretary of State’s State Voting Guide that was mailed to all households for the November 2022 Election. All people with disabilities are better able participate in voting due to DRRI content included in the State Guide. In Rhode Island, the Board of Elections trains and educates all poll workers across the state with oral presentation, power points and a Poll Worker Manual that poll workers are required to review and bring to their assigned polls. In FY2023, DRRI educated poll workers by providing disability-related voting rights and best practices information for the mandatory training materials for all RI poll workers. The RI Board of Elections incorporated DRRI’s proposed content into the Poll Worker Manual that poll workers read. DRRI trained Board of Elections staff regarding poll place accessibility in FY2022 for the FY2023 General Election. DRRI trained volunteers with the Common Cause Election Protection program about the types of issues that should be reported to DRRI on election day. These efforts reached 2500 poll workers, staff, and volunteers and are reported in Section J for PAVA Program Performance Measurements. While DRRI views the impact of uniformly educating poll workers about voting rights and best practices working with people with disabilities as potentially impacting all voters with disabilities in RI, these activities will be reported in terms of the number of Election Officials trained and not counted here as impacting all 228,300 voters with disabilities. Since there is no appropriate performance measure option in this ONE PPR section, the number provided is 0. In FY2023, DRRI monitored state implementation of electronic voting processes that enable people with disabilities to vote from home using their own assistive technology. In previous years, DRRI had advocated for an electronic option for applying for a mail ballot application. As noted in the PAVA Narrative, in FY2023 the State commenced use of an on-line portal that enables RI voters with disabilities who have a state ID issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles to apply for a mail ballot application on-line with their own personal device. This change in operations potentially impacts all people with disabilities who have a State issued ID by making electoral participation easier. The number is approximately 235,800 people and was reported in the PAVA performance measures. To avoid duplication of impact, the number 1 will be utilized here for a performance measure.",,,,,
SC,2020,"The PAVA Coordinator provided ongoing guidance to individual counties about polling place accessibility.  The State Election Commission contacted the Coordinator many times asking for clarification of accessibility issues and the DOJ checklist.  A hotline was monitored for both the November 2019 and February 2020 elections. The PAVA Coordinator assisted a number of callers in registering to vote.  This included assistance filling out forms, sending registrations forms and stamps to individual voters, and connecting voters with the offices of voter registration in their respective counties.  We were not able to specifically target voters under 30 but that has been continued as a priority for 2020-2021. Priorities changed pretty quickly when pandemic voting became the priority.  However, the PAVA Coordinator was able to pivot quickly to virtual education events and start recording videos educating voters that could be reposted by our various community partners. Five videos were produced. We prioritized absentee voting and were able to educate many voters on that process, whether mail in or in person.  The goal was met by a combination of 6 live presentations in addition to the videos.  The intake and referral team were updated almost weekly on changes that were happening in the state regarding absentee voting and they were able to advise callers about their options. The PAVA Coordinator chaired 8 meetings of the SC Disability Voting Coalition and the members were involved in much of the outreach done over the year. P&A utilized an on line survey to solicit information from individuals with disabilities and their families. The survey was made available at several conferences P&A attended throughout the fiscal year. The proposed priorities were also published online and sent out through P&A's newsletter on June 24. Comments were due back by September 1, prior to the September 12 Board meeting when the goals and priorities for FY 21 were reviewed and adopted. The survey was announced by a P&A e-blast to over 900 individuals and organizations including disability advocacy organizations . The survey also was placed on Facebook with over 1100 followers and on Twitter with nearly 400 followers. It was also included as a tag line on outgoing staff emails during the period, including communication with DD/TBI/AT/PAVA-eligible clients. Unfortunately, due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, the group sessions normally held with residents of the two state mental health hospitals were cancelled this year; these hospitals have residents who are TBI and DD-eligible and most would be of voting age. Throughout the year P&A sends satisfaction surveys to individuals who have been provided with information and referral services or clients whose cases are being closed. The survey includes a section requesting problem issues the individual believes P&A should work on. Also our existing goals and priorities are on our website and include a notice requesting comments.",,,,,
SC,2021,"The PAVA Coordinator visited three counties and advised on polling place accessibility.  Two reports were written and shared with the counties and the state election commission.  Many of the recommendations were adopted. PAVA Coordinator served as a liason between county election staff and the DOJ in questions about polling place accessibility, most often to remedy some part of the DOJ checklist that was unclear or seemed redundant. DRSC conducted the requisite meetings of the Disability Voting Coalition and presented them with opportunities to engage with PAVA programming.",,,,,

1. Election Protection Collaboration DRSC is collaborating with the NAACP, the Legal Defense Fund, Black Voters Matter, League of Women Voters, Upstate Action Alliance, and other groups of SC lawyers, legal protections groups, and elections advocates. DRSC participated in monitoring elections through polling place surveys and responding to complaints of accessibility related elections interference. 

DRSC held a convening with 105 attendants from throughout the state. Most of the attendants were poll workers, election monitors, or legal defenders. Two members of the Disability Voting Coalition (representing USC AT and Equip) came with DRSC staff to deliver a conversation on legal protection in voting and access to polling places. Attendants learned about the importance of election day and year-round voting accessibility, the different AT systems available to voters, and the different rules around assistance and curbside voting. By training these stakeholders we grew the number of poll workers and election protection volunteers that understand the civil rights of PWD, and to call us with any individual advocacy needs. (PAVA) 

These volunteers are prepared to monitor and serve at polling places on election day(PAVA funding)

The estimate of this intervention is based on 105 attendees.",,,,,
SD,2020,"DRSD PAVA Program was invited to assist the Minnehaha County Auditor to conduct a polling site ADA Compliance review. PAVA, PADD, and PAIR Program Leads collaborated with the Minnehaha County Auditor and Sioux Falls City Election Official to conduct ADA compliance review of all polling sites. Seventy polling sites were monitored for ADA accessibility compliance. County Auditors collaborate with local communities in utilizing a variety of local buildings during elections. Buildings used include county courthouses, city offices, churches, community (town) halls, schools, and fire stations. In rural/frontier areas and Native Nations, satellite voting and private homes are utilized. Eleven sites were found to have some form of access issues, including lack of accessible parking signs, elevated spaces from parking lot to sidewalk, and lack of designated accessible parking. PAVA provided findings to the Minnehaha County Auditor and Sioux Falls City Election Official and continues to collaborate with them to ensure these concerns are being rectified.

DRSD PAVA, PADD, and PAIR Program Leads collaborated with County Auditors to conduct polling site reviews for ADA compliance in Moody, Turner, Lake, and Lincoln Counties. The Flandreau Tribal Nation resides within Moody County. Thirty-Five sites were monitored for designated accessible parking, parking lot condition, curb cuts, pathways, ramps, door openers, and threshold height.

These are agency-wide priorities applying to all DRSD programs, not just the four ACL programs. I&R priorities were repeated or apply across all goal areas.  It is therefore unclear how we are to use the ""performance measures"" listed at the end of this  and other I&R/Technical Assistance entries, also given the fact that performance measures are asked for in other places in the PPR. It is also not clear that any of the performance measures available apply, yet one must be chosen to eliminate a validation error. As a result, we chose a performance measure and placed a zero (0) for a numeric value.

DRSD’s Intake Team provides Information and Referral or Self-Advocacy Assistance (which we referred to as “Technical Assistance” at the time of developing the FY 2020 goals and priorities) on all intakes that are not assigned as cases. DRSD takes pride in being able to provide all callers with at least some helpful information or guidance when we cannot assign the caller to an advocate or attorney.  PAVA had 7 I&Rs in FY 2020, which were provided to 7 individuals.

DRSD Bridging South Dakota (BSD) Liaison received requests for technical assistance from three domestic violence shelters-information provided included other agency resources, guardianship, absentee voting and obtaining a protection order. 

DRSD staff attorney presented information to the South Dakota Network Against Family Violence and Sexual Assault (The Network) on a new South Dakota state law regarding Informed Consent for testing following a sexual assault.

DRSD PAVA Lead worked with Secretary of State office to provide information to Crisis shelters on how to assist individuals with absentee voting while maintaining victim’s safety. See PAVA Goal 1, I&R or Technical Assistance.  

In addition, DRSD staff conducted outreach to increase awareness of DRSD among military veterans. The staff from DRSD made outreach visits to twelve county Veteran Service Officers across the state in an effort to increase awareness of the programs and services that are offered by DRSD and are available to military veterans with disabilities. Staff provided information and informational material to each County VSO to pass along or make available to the veterans that they serve. Information provided included information on voting rights and how to participate in the electoral process in South Dakota. Outreach projects were slowed down after March of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. See PAVA Goal 1, I&R or Technical Assistance.

Specific electoral activities include:
DRSD Intake Specialists asked all new callers if they were registered to vote. If callers indicated they were not, a voter registration packet would be offered and sent if requested. Six individuals requested a voter registration packet be sent. Voter registration packets included: South Dakota Voter Registration form; Voting, Everything You Need to Know DRSD voting brochure; voting rights wallet card; Vote, The Real Power bracelet; and DRSD phone wallet. See PAVA Goal 1, Collaboration.

SDCL 12-19-9.1 requires South Dakota County Auditors, or their representative, to go into any Nursing facility, assisted living center, or hospital which has multiple (5 or more) absentee ballot requests to conduct onsite absentee voting at the facility during general elections. To ensure safety of their residents during COVID-19 Pandemic, South Dakota Nursing Facilities stopped allowing individuals who were not staff access to their facilities.

DRSD PAVA, PADD and PAIR program leads collaborated calling nursing facilities to ensure residents were able to exercise their right to vote. DRSD staff provided information to nursing facility staff regarding conducting absentee voting and provided suggestions on ways a County Auditor could conduct absentee voting safely. DRSD staff contacted 103 facilities which fall under SDCL 12-19-9.1, determining a total of 1,855 individuals were able to vote via absentee ballot. DRSD's approach to Monitoring begins by selecting facilities/service providers.  DRSD identifies facilities and service providers to monitor by evaluating information from DRSD intake staff and case handlers, information from public sources/service providers, incident reports, client reports, and other sources.  Monitoring teams generally include two staff and they typically monitor a total of three times over a three-month period.  The first day of monitoring is an announced visit, as we want to make sure the administrator will be available to provide a tour and to interview.  Subsequent visits may be announced or unannounced.  In addition to meeting with individuals with disabilities, monitoring staff also meet with non-administrative staff, using interview forms DRSD has created to steer the conversation to obtain information about the agency's practices in several areas.  Monitoring staff also complete an Observation Checklist that looks at many areas of potential safety concerns.  Monitoring takes place at an agency's main facility, as well as at individual residences (with the individuals' permission).  An important element of monitoring is developing relationships between DRSD staff and the people living or working in that facility.  These relationships promote contact and future calls to DRSD by participants to address concerns.  DRSD also offers to provide rights training for individuals and staff.  As a result of Monitoring, DRSD shares findings, concerns, and recommendations with the facility/service provider and follows-up as needed.  If working with the agency does not resolve concerns, DRSD may open an investigation or forward the concerns to applicable regulatory agencies.

PADD, PAAT, PATBI, and PAVA each participate in Monitoring.  While PADD is limited to providers serving individuals with developmental disabilities, PAAT may participate at any location, PAVA may participate at any provider with individuals at or near voting age, and PATBI may participate at any provider that may serve individuals with a TBI.  

In FY 2020,  DRSD's ability to monitor facilities/service providers was significantly impacted by the Covid-19 Pandemic.  Some monitoring had to be completed through virtual means, such as via Zoom.",,,,,
SD,2021,"DRSD Staff advocated for voter registration to be included in IEP transition planning while participating in IEP Transition meetings. One student was of voting age and was provided with a voter registration form, information on how to vote, and disability voting rights.  

DRSD PAVA Lead collaborated with Communication Services for the Deaf (CSD) to incorporate DRSD-created slides into a Power Point presentation on transition under IDEA. CSD staff utilized slides on disability voting rights and electoral participation when providing training to deaf students and special education teachers on transition. DRSD Staff participate in State HAVA board meetings and Board of Elections meetings ensuring the rights of individuals with disabilities are included in discussions related to the electoral process.  

DRSD PAVA Lead worked with the Secretary of State's office to provide information to crisis shelters on how to assist individuals with absentee voting while maintaining victim’s safety.

DRSD staff provided proponent testimony during a Legislative hearing, allowing for individuals who have a protection order, or are receiving crisis shelter services, to have their names excluded from public inspection or copying of voter registration lists. 

DRSD PAVA Lead collaborated with Communication Services for the Deaf (CSD) to incorporate DRSD created slides into a Power Point presentation on transition under IDEA. CSD staff utilized slides on disability voting rights and electoral participation when providing training to deaf students and special education teachers on transition. 

DRSD PAVA continued to serve on the South Dakota State Independent Living Council (SILC). PAVA staff participated in quarterly SILC meetings to discuss the activities and services provided by the state’s two independent living service agencies. SILC participants ensure the services provided by the agencies are conducted as stated in the State Plan for Independent Living. PAVA staff also participates in two SILC committees, which focus on Advocacy/Interagency Collaboration and Assistive Technology/Home Modifications Adaptive Devices. PAVA staff ensure voting rights and election participation are included in discussions regarding independent living skills and transition services planning. 

Intake staff asked all new callers if they were registered to vote. If callers indicated they were not, a voter registration packet would be offered and sent if requested. Voter registration packets included a South Dakota Voter Registration form, ""Voting, Everything You Need to Know"" DRSD voting brochure, voting rights wallet card, DRSD phone wallet, and PAVA Lead business card. 

DRSD staff received a request for additional voting rights information from a community behavioral health hospital to be shared with individuals receiving services to replace depleted informational brochures provided from a previous outreach activity.  

DRSD Partners in Policymaking (PIP) program provides continuing education classes for past PIP graduates during the final yearly session/graduation held in April. PAVA staff was scheduled to provide training on voting rights, registering to vote, and the importance of voting and participating in the electoral process by being an election worker during a continuing education session. PAVA staff was unable to provide this training because continuing education sessions were cancelled due to continued concerns regarding COVID-19. South Dakota Codified Law requires all election changes to be done legislatively. The South Dakota Board of Elections proposes election law changes through the Secretary of State's office to the legislature to be considered as bills. DRSD Executive Director and PAVA Lead met with the Secretary of State’s office and South Dakota Board of Elections to discuss concerns regarding the inaccessibility of South Dakota’s absentee ballots for individuals with print disabilities. A request was made by the board to provide information on how other states make their absentee ballots accessible for individuals with print disabilities. Information regarding other state’s incorporating individuals with disabilities under the UOCAVA system was shared with the Board of Elections. DRSD established Goal VII, Miscellaneous, for FY 2021 to strike a balance between its topical goal areas and the need to be able to efficiently record activities into the DAD system.  Priority 7.2 is where DRSD recorded all non-case activity (projects) except for monitoring and investigations.  Many of these activities are described elsewhere in this PPR, such as in the ""Description of P&A Operations"" and the ""Collaborations"" sections.  The following are examples of activities under 7.2 that are not discussed in other sections of this PPR.

Education/Training

DRSD conducts numerous training activities throughout the year, many of which are multi-program efforts in order to combine expertise and offer well-developed education and training opportunities across our state. Some examples are as follows:

1)  Disability Rights South Dakota’s Adult Team worked throughout the year to provide rights education and training to individuals being served at the South Dakota Developmental Center (SDDC) in Redfield, SD. These visits were largely virtual as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, until the middle of the year when changing safety guidelines allowed Advocates to visit the premises in-person. Education efforts covered various rights issues, such as abuse and neglect, community access, access to education, voting rights, guardianship issues, and employment. The training was provided via zoom and in-person utilizing a jeopardy-style trivia game, posing questions and expounding on answers with rights information and abuse and neglect prevention education. Various other tactile games and activities were utilized to engage participants in a dynamic way with the information being provided. The purpose of these efforts was to ensure access to the P&A and educate individuals on abuse, neglect, and rights advocacy. 

2)  The DRSD Operations Director gave a training presentation to attendees of the South Dakota Conference on Developmental Disabilities. Topics covered included Disability Rights South Dakota services and programs, individual rights, and guardianship issues.  Educational materials were disseminated. Approximately 25 individuals attended the presentation, including disability professionals, individuals with disabilities, and their families. 

3)  Throughout the year, a Disability Rights South Dakota Advocate provided new hire training to staff at a Central South Dakota Community Support Provider. Education centered on Disability Rights South Dakota’s mission and the programs and services provided by the agency, and also addressed abuse, neglect, and rights violations. 

4)  For the 29th consecutive year, Disability Rights South Dakota provided a six-month self-advocacy training course for individuals with disabilities and their families, as well as their support staff and advocates. Partners in Policymaking is an annual extensive training program that teaches self-advocacy skills, legislative knowledge, and provides networking opportunities for individuals with disabilities and those who support them. Partners in Policymaking (PIP) also teaches its participants where and how to obtain services, focusing on education, community inclusion, housing, Social Security, and abuse and neglect. Participants learn about disability-centered history, specifically focusing on rights and person-first language and systemic change. 16 participants graduated in 2021, which was a smaller class than usual due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The community inclusion, development of skills, and the use of those skills will continue over the lifetime of the graduates. South Dakota’s Partners in Policymaking class was the ONLY class in the nation that met in-person for the training last year, with staff enforcing extensive safety measures and taking various precautions to keep attendees safe for this important training.

5)  DRSD staff presented an hour-long training to inform attendees about the rights of individuals with disabilities when they present negative behaviors caused by those disabilities. The training focused on behaviors in daycare, school, and employment, and the protections for behaviors under the ADA, IDEA, and other employment laws. Staff informed attendees about individual rights under applicable laws and strategies that might help reduce negative behaviors in the future. Attendees left with a better understanding of protections for behaviors and the importance of addressing behaviors as they arise.

DRSD PADD staff conducted in-person training for Bridging South Dakota (built as a collaboration between SD Network Against Family Violence and Sexual Assault, and Communication Services for the Deaf) to provide information and assistance to individuals with disabilities, staff at crisis shelters, staff at victim services agencies, first responders, and disability services agency staff regarding the intersection of sexual assault/domestic violence and individuals with disabilities. As a result of the training, disability services agencies gained knowledge of Bridging South Dakota, victims services agencies, and how to work with an individual who discloses an assault. Crisis shelters gained knowledge of disability etiquette, accessibility issues, service animal education, and were taught strategies to work with individuals with disabilities who have experienced trauma.  

There are four agencies which provide Conflict Free Case Management for individuals with Developmental Disabilities (DD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID) in South Dakota. DRSD PADD staff conducted a mass email outreach to 18 Conflict Free Case Managers (CFCM) at all four facilities to ensure individuals with disabilities who are victims and survivors of sexual assault are aware of and able to access assistance from victim services agencies. Information was provided to CFCMs on Bridging South Dakota (BSD) regarding BSD Liaisons and the intersection of DD/ID and Sexual Assault services. As such, Conflict Free Case Managers gained knowledge of and information on victim services and programs.

PATBI staff presented information to directors of shelters for victims of intimate partner violence. The presentation was done via virtual platform and included information on the prevalence of traumatic brain injury in incidents of intimate partner violence. Information was also provided on the importance of screening for the presence of undiagnosed traumatic brain injuries. Being aware of this could impact on the type of services that are provided to the individual who is seeking assistance from the shelters. A Power Point presentation was used to provide information on what a traumatic brain injury is and the impact it can have on a person. 

Other Systemic Activities

PADD, PAAT, PATBI, and PAVA staff served on several boards and committees that impact individuals with disabilities, their families, and those who support them. Many of these efforts are listed under the Collaborations section of this report. Some additional boards and committees are as follows: PADD participated on the Minnehaha County JDAI Partnership Committee, the Minnehaha County Facility Inspection Team, the Supporting Families Community of Practice, the Dyslexia Stakeholders Committee, and the Employment First Work Group.  PADD and PATBI participated on the SD DOE Data Drill-Down Stakeholder Session.  PADD, PAAT, and PATBI participated on the South Dakota Advisory Panel for Children with Disabilities and the Interagency Transition Council. PADD, PAAT, PATBI, and PAVA participated on the Disability Awareness and Accessibility Review Board, and the DRSD Legal Director serves on the State Bar of South Dakota CLE Committee, the State Bar of South Dakota Legal Services Committee, and the Dakota Plains Legal Services Board. 

Some specific examples of boards and committees, and their impact on the communities we serve, are as follows: PADD staff served on the Lifespan Respite Care Coalition, an ongoing 3-year project which proposes to build an infrastructure for a sustainable, evidence-based lifespan respite care program accessible to caregivers. PADD, PAAT, and PATBI staff served on the South Dakota Advisory Panel for Children with Disabilities to provide input and direction to the South Dakota Department of Education on issues involving special education, specifically working to close the gap that exists between schools and families as a result of poor communication methods and practices between schools and parents of students with disabilities.

PATBI staff participated in a workgroup whose purpose was the creation of a traumatic brain injury Medicaid waiver supported by the State of South Dakota. The workgroup’s efforts involved planning and creating a survey that was sent out to professionals in the state who provide services to individuals who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. An additional survey for caregivers and individuals who have suffered a traumatic brain injury was also discussed. The group consisted of disability advocates, healthcare professionals, personal care professionals, family members, and individuals who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. 

PATBI staff sat on the board of directors for the Brain Injury Alliance of South Dakota. In addition to assisting individuals who have suffered a traumatic brain injury, the primary focus of the BIASD was to provide input into the efforts taking place to create a Medicaid waiver in the state of South Dakota for people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury.

DRSD provided comments in support of proposed rule changes within the SD Department of Social Services which would allow for tele-health services in instances where such supports can be effectively provided. These supports had been implemented as a result of COVID precautions. The Department elected to make the option available by Rule because of their effectiveness and accessibility. DRSD similarly provided comments to the SD Department of Human Services regarding changes to be made to the HOPE Waiver. 

DRSD PATBI staff participated in 9 systemic projects to PRTF facilities in the state. The purpose of the projects was to increase awareness regarding the benefits of screening for undiagnosed traumatic brain injuries in youth receiving services from the PRTF facility. If the possibility of an undiagnosed traumatic brain injury exists, then treatment programs can be created that take that possibility into consideration and as a result could become more effective and beneficial to the child who is receiving the services. 

SDCL 12-19-9.1 requires South Dakota County Auditors, or their representative, to go into any nursing facility, assisted living center, or hospital which has multiple (5 or more) absentee ballot requests to conduct onsite absentee voting at the facility during general elections. To ensure safety of their residents during COVID-19 Pandemic, South Dakota nursing facilities stopped allowing individuals who were not staff to access their facilities. DRSD PAVA and PAIR programs collaborated calling nursing facilities to ensure residents were able to exercise their right to vote. DRSD staff provided information to nursing facility staff regarding conducting absentee voting and provided suggestions on ways a County Auditor could conduct absentee voting safely. DRSD staff contacted 103 facilities which fall under SDCL 12-19-9.1, determining upon follow-up that a total of 1,855 individuals were able to vote via absentee ballot.",,,,,
SD,2023,"DRSD was made aware of an act of violence perpetrated by a juvenile with disabilities served at one of the state’s largest Community Support Providers against a staff person employed there, and out of concern for other children (and staff) subsequently decided to monitor the agency’s Children's Services division. DRSD staff toured the facility and met with staff and individuals served at the location during 3 in-person visits held across 7 months.  No serious concerns came to DRSD’s attention during the monitoring visits, but Advocates received reports of misconduct and incorrect reporting practices from employees. DRSD provided education and information to staff concerning resources for their own personal assistance, and to assist clients served at the location.  

DRSD performed a year-long monitoring at the state’s Developmental Center, in order to help ensure that the individuals served within the facility were in a safe environment and free from abuse and neglect. DRSD performed 7 visits throughout the year, providing education and information to the individuals at the Developmental Center, and monitoring their living conditions and services to protect them from rights violations, abuse, and neglect. 

DRSD chose a Community Support Provider to monitor across the PADD, PATBI, and PAVA programs as a result of new ownership and subsequent limited communication from the agency. DRSD completed three in-person visits, wherein we interviewed staff and individuals served at the agency.  We visited numerous group homes and the day services area. At one group home, DRSD noticed a loose safety railing, and unsecured chemicals at another. DRSD addressed these concerns with staff, and reiterated the importance of safety in group home settings. The concerns were addressed, and individuals were able to live and access services in a safer environment. DRSD Staff participate in State HAVA board meetings and Board of Elections meetings ensuring the rights of individuals with disabilities are included in discussions related to the electoral process.   

The DRSD PAVA Lead continued to serve on the South Dakota State Independent Living Council (SILC), and was reappointed through June 30, 2026. SILC participants attend quarterly meetings to discuss the activities and services provided by the state’s two independent living service agencies. SILC participants ensure the services provided by the agencies are conducted as stated in the State Plan for Independent Living. DRSD/PAVA staff also participates on a SILC committee, which is focused on Advocacy/Interagency Collaboration. PAVA staff ensure voting rights and elections participation are included in discussions regarding independent living skills training and transition services planning.

Intake staff ask all new callers if they are registered to vote. If callers indicated they were not, a voter registration packet would be offered and sent if requested. Voter registration packets included: South Dakota Voter Registration form; Voting, Everything You Need to Know DRSD voting brochure; and a voting rights wallet card.

Two individuals with disabilities contacted DRSD for specific assistance in obtaining and completing the voter registration process. The PAVA Lead worked with clients to complete and return their voter registration forms, making them eligible to vote in the FY2023 municipal and mid-term elections.

DRSD staff conduct outreach and training at various agencies across the state including, but not limited to, community support agencies, Independent Living agencies, nursing facilities, behavioral health agencies, DD/IDD community support providers, transition services programs, State DD/IDD and Mental health residential services, and Veteran’s services. DRSD PAVA received one call regarding polling site access during the November 8, 2022, mid-term elections.  DRSD Intake staff provided the individual with information about a polling site closer to the voter’s home which was fully accessible. 

DRSD staff conducted polling site monitoring/observations during the November 8, 2022, mid-term elections. Some identified issues were addressed in real time and resolved while staff were at the site. However, there were eight counties with issues which resulted in DRSD filing a HAVA complaint on behalf of voters due to access issues related to the ES&S Express Vote, Ballot Marking Device (BMD). Issues observed included the BMD being placed against a wall at the back of the room where individuals with disabilities were unable to get through tables to reach it, BMDs not being set up and ready to go, BMDs placed in a manner with no privacy when voting, and a software issue that was not addressed making the BMD inoperable.  

A settlement was reached between DRSD, Board of Elections/SOS, and the auditors from the eight counties. In the agreement, the auditors took responsibility for the issues and agreed to implementing steps to ensure all individuals will have access to the BMD and private voting in future elections. The DRSD Executive Director and PAVA staff participated in a January 23, 2023, training provided by the Secretary of State office and Board of Elections (BOE) for Legislators and the subsequent BOE meeting. Legislators and BOE members were provided with information regarding the importance and ease of use for the ExpressVote BMD and were provided with a demonstration of the BMD. During a subsequent public meeting, the PAVA Program Lead rebutted public comments regarding Ballot Marking Devices not being needed. PAVA staff explained the importance of having BMDs in polling sites to allow individuals with disabilities to vote privately and independently. PAVA staff also encouraged all to use the BMD, explaining it is available for anyone to use, not just for individuals with disabilities, and emphasized they are secure because they are not connected to the internet.

PAVA staff received an invitation from the Secretary of State to participate in a bi-annual training conference for all the county auditors scheduled for October 18, 2023. PAVA staff will focus on issues identified by DRSD staff while conducting polling site observations and the importance of the BMD and other assistive technology for voters. South Dakota County Auditors are the local election officers responsible for conducting voting. Attendance will consist of all 66 county auditors and/or their representatives. Since HAVA legislation, the meeting is held in the fall before general or statewide elections. The meeting is a way to address and share the impact of proposed HAVA-directed changes. The county auditors take the information/instructions back to their counties and apply them to the local environment. Their responsibilities include training of paid poll workers and volunteers involved in the elections process and ensuring poll sites are accessible. PAVA staff will provide training to approximately 119 elections officials during the October 18, 2023, training, attendees will be provided with an ""Everything You Need to Know about Voting"" brochure by DRSD staff. DRSD PAVA staff conducted a combined 62 education/training and outreach activities, with 375 individuals receiving training. The training incorporated information regarding voting rights of people with disabilities and the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), including the state process for filing a HAVA complaint. Training was conducted at various agencies and facilities, including Community Support Providers, State Developmental Disabilities Center, Behavioral Health units, community mental health agencies, nursing and assisted living facilities, and community outreach events.

DRSD's Partners in Policymaking (PIP) program provides continuing education classes for past PIP graduates during the final yearly session/graduation held in April. PAVA staff provided training during a continuing education session on voting rights, registering to vote, the importance of voting both in general and local elections, the process for filing a HAVA complaint, and the ability to participate in the electoral process by being an election worker. DRSD established Goal 7, Miscellaneous, to strike a balance between its topical goal areas and the need to be able to efficiently record activities into the DAD system. Priority 7.2 is where DRSD recorded all non-case activity (projects) except for monitoring and investigations. Many of these activities are described elsewhere in this PPR, such as in the ""Description of P&A Operations"" and the ""Collaborations"" sections. Performance Measures are set out in Part III of this PPR.

The following are examples of activities under 7.2.

EDUCATION/TRAINING

DRSD conducts numerous Education/Training activities throughout the year, many of which are multi-program efforts in order to combine expertise and offer well-developed education and training opportunities across our state. Some examples are as follows:

1. Disability Rights South Dakota’s Adult Team worked throughout the year to provide rights education and training to individuals being served at the South Dakota Developmental Center (SDDC) in Redfield, SD. These efforts consisted of monthly in-person visits to the facility, where DRSD staff met with individuals receiving services and support staff in different areas such as education, direct support, medical, administration, and human rights. Efforts focused on rights education, specifically the issues of abuse and neglect, community access, access to education, voting rights, guardianship, and employment. The training was provided in-person utilizing various interactive games that combined physical activities with education, encouraging participation and information retention. The purpose of these efforts was to ensure access to the P&A and educate individuals on abuse, neglect, and rights advocacy.

2. Disability Rights South Dakota collaborated with South Dakota Parent Connection (Parent Training and Information Center) to create and publish a booklet entitled, ""Preparing for the Future ... Understanding Guardianship and Alternatives.""  Partially to promote the booklet, DRSD and South Dakota Parent Connection further collaborated by providing education/training sessions about guardianship and its alternatives at three state-wide conferences:  Lighting the Way (Autism) Conference; Transition Services Liaison Program Summer Institute; and the Statewide Developmental Disabilities Conference.  Attendees included students, parents, educators, and other professionals. DRSD provided three additional similar trainings on guardianship and alternatives.  One was in collaboration with the Division of Developmental Disabilities over Zoom, and two were at Community Support Providers. Attendees at these events included individuals with disabilities, their guardians, support staff, and teachers or other disability professionals. 

3. For the 31th consecutive year, Disability Rights South Dakota provided a six-month self-advocacy training course for individuals with disabilities and their families, as well as their support staff and advocates. Partners in Policymaking is an annual extensive training program that teaches self-advocacy skills, legislative knowledge, and provides networking opportunities for individuals with disabilities and those who support them. Partners in Policymaking (PIP) also teaches its participants where and how to obtain services, focusing on education, community inclusion, housing, Social
Security, and abuse and neglect. Participants learn about disability-centered history, specifically focusing on rights and person-first language and systemic change. Eighteen participants graduated in 2023. The community inclusion, development of skills, and the use of those skills will continue over the lifetime of the graduates. Disability Rights South Dakota’s Partners in Policymaking class is the only class in the nation that met in-person every year since its inception. 

4.  Disability Rights South Dakota presented to Northern State University advanced post-secondary students about legal protections for special education students and common issues that DRSD addresses in that field, such as exclusion from school, restraint and seclusion, transition services, and guardianship.  DRSD also discussed DRSD's mission and role.

5.  DRSD provided information about DRSD programs and training to LEND students from the Center for Disabilities.  The purpose was to train medical professionals in advocacy for people with disabilities, how to approach legislators at the state capitol, and regarding collaborations of the DD Network (DRSD, DD Council, UCEDD).

6.  Disability Rights South Dakota PATBI staff presented at community mental health centers in the state on the topic of screening for undiagnosed traumatic brain injuries. The purpose of the presentation was to increase awareness of the possible presence of a traumatic brain injury and the impact that it may have on mental illness and the treatment of individuals who have been diagnosed with mental illness. 

7. PAVA staff presented on voting rights to transition students at a transition program.

EDUCATING POLICYMAKERS

DRSD received reports from individuals who had experienced modification or reduction of benefits and services provided by the State. These individuals had followed the appeals process and subsequently the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)’s favorable decision was rejected by the State, which is allowed by administrative rule and law. The appeals process was not clear, nor were the rules concerning the ALJ’s decision and whether the individuals must have exhausted all administrative remedies before pursuing the appeals process in the court system. 

In 2023, as part of an ongoing effort to address the issues reported by individuals with disabilities and their families, DRSD spent a significant amount of time educating legislators and urging their review of the waiver programs and systems in place to support individuals with disabilities, with the ultimate goal being access to services and due process. These efforts resulted in the legislative body ordering an independent study to review the Family Support 360 Medicaid Waiver, and the Shared Living program, which is a component of the CHOICES Medicaid waiver. 

The independent study connected with more than 200 stakeholders within the state via interviews and listening sessions, collected more than 500 survey responses, and conducted 85 unique interviews across the state. Part of the findings of the study included an echo of what DRSD had heard and reported to the legislature and the Division of Developmental Disabilities: individuals felt there was no way to appeal a denial without the process becoming adversarial. The recommendation to the Division was to develop a complaint and grievance process, and institute an ombudsman to help families raise issues and seek resolutions. Further, the study found that individuals and their families were surprised to find the Department of Human Services could overturn fair hearing results when denials or terminations were appealed within the existing system, and were confused about the steps to pursue due process. The recommendation to the Division of Developmental Disabilities was to include a full description of the appeals process in any denial notices.

These recommendations, when implemented, are designed ensure individuals with developmental disabilities are better able to understand and access services and their due process rights within the state. This is a direct result of DRSD assisting individuals and their families through self-advocacy to be heard by the legislature, and DRSD testifying and educating legislators about the concerns and needs of individuals with disabilities across the state. 


OTHER SYSTEMIC (NON-LITIGATION) ACTIVITIES

DRSD believes that being part of policymaking boards, committees, and councils is an effective way of having systemic impact.  However, it is often difficult to attempt to determine effectively how many individuals with disabilities are potentially impacted, let alone assign numbers to specific performance measures.  The following describes several boards/committees/councils in which the ACL programs participated, as well as additional systemic (non-litigation) activities.

DRSD participated in the Supporting Families Community of Practice workgroup to build capacity within South Dakota to build policies, practices, and systems to better assist and support families that include individuals with ID/DD. 

The DRSD PAAT Program Lead continues to serve on the Interagency Transition Council. This group, comprised of professionals mostly from the Sioux Falls vicinity, such as Vocational Rehabilitation, several public schools, Transition Services Liaison Project, Division of Developmental Disabilities, Center for Disabilities (UCEDD), and others, meet monthly to share information and ideas on transition services.

The PAAT Lead was also able to work with the Citizen’s Advisory Council of Sioux Falls and the surrounding areas regarding issues of sidewalk and community access for individuals who use mobility devices. Advocates worked with state and local agencies on assistive technology needs and what AT services each agency can provide, or any needs identified and how to best meets the needs. 

Disability Rights South Dakota's PATBI Program Lead is on the South Dakota Advisory Panel for Children with Disabilities.  The panel addressed the issue of poor communication between schools and parents and addressed the manner that parents can access resources that will help them better understand special education and also better advocate for their children. 

Disability Rights South Dakota's PABTI Program Lead is also on the board of directors for the Brain Injury Alliance of South Dakota. The issue of services for individuals who have suffered a TBI was addressed.  The organization also hosts support groups and provides information and referrals to other organizations that may be able to provide needed services to individuals in the state who have suffered a TBI.

The DRSD Executive Director participated as a member of the state Council on Developmental Disabilities (DD Council).  This is discussed in detail in the Collaborations section.

DRSD participates on the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI) Partnership Committee. This committee meets quarterly to review statistics and initiatives, provide suggestions and guidance, and monitor implementation of JDAI in Minnehaha County.  DRSD participates as a community member interested in ensuring consideration of youth with disabilities.

DRSD participated in the South Dakota Department of Education Statewide Data Drilldown.  DRSD reviewed data and heard information on statewide special education performance.  DRSD provided feedback to the state Department of Education on performance issues.  The board/committee addressed the issue of appropriate suspension of students and reviewed the process; it also addressed transition services.  A result was changes in the way the state reviews how local school districts conduct long-term suspensions, which should result in students being less likely to be subject to improper suspensions.

DRSD participated on the Disability Awareness and Accessibility Review Board.  This board is an extension of the Sioux Falls Human Relations Commission and acts as an advisory committee to the Mayor, City Council, and ADA Coordinator on disability awareness and universal accessibility of city buildings, programs, and services.  This board provides education to heighten the awareness of physical, social, and economic barriers for persons with disabilities, organizes public awareness activities, and educates the public about the role, function, and activities of the Human Relations Commission.

There are always questions about the transfer of rights at age eighteen and the need to consider guardianship.  Parents often report that their schools inform them that they MUST obtain guardianship by their child's eighteenth birthday.  This has resulted in many unneeded guardianships.  To help answer the questions that parents, students, school personnel, and other professionals may have, DRSD and South Dakota Parent Connection decided to create and publish a booklet on guardianship, but most importantly, on lesser restrictive alternatives that may be appropriate.  Work began on this project in FY 2022.  The 28-page booklet, ""Preparing for the Future ... Understanding Guardianship and Alternatives,"" was completed and published in FY 2023; booklets became available in early June 2023.  While the booklet is aimed at students who will be turning age eighteen, the content is applicable to any age where guardianship is considered.

In FY 2007, DRSD, in collaboration with South Dakota Parent Connection, the Transition Services Liaison Project, and the Center for Disabilities, completed and published ""What Parents Should Know ... About Special Education in South Dakota.""  The DRSD Legal Director wrote the 240-page book and received editorial and content suggestions from the other agencies. At the end of FY 2023, work began, in collaboration with South Dakota Parent Connection and the Center for Disabilities, to revamp and revise the book, giving it a new look.  It will be completed in FY 2024.

DRSD completed translation of its DRSD brochure, PAVA brochure, and CAP brochure into Spanish.",,,,,
TN,2023,"DRT’s voting team conducted poll site accessibility surveys on November 8, 2022 to ensure that polling locations across the state are free of physical barriers. DRT recruited 33 volunteers to assist with these efforts including DRT staff, law students from Vanderbilt’s Law Students for Social Justice Program, and State Voices and the CivicTN coalition. This year, DRT focused survey efforts on larger counties across the grand regions of the state, surveying a total of 192 polling locations across Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Montgomery, Shelby, and Williamson Counties. Following Election Day efforts, the PAVA team analyzed the results of the surveys in an effort to identify statewide and county trends, create focused advocacy plans for each county, and to implement remedies at the county level and provide targeted training to election officials. Of the sites surveyed, only 4% of sites statewide were free of accessibility barriers, with the lack of adequate accessible parking OR accessible parking that is not on the shortest route to the accessible entrance being the primary issues identified across sites and counties. 
Parking discrepancies were most commonly identified at schools across counties as well. A general overview of county findings and responses is outlined below. In Davidson County, DRT surveyed 77 sites and accessible parking violations were identified at 24 sites. 
In response to DRT’s findings and ongoing discussions with the county Administrator of Elections, Davidson County purchased over 100 collapsible cones with designated accessible parking symbols attached to create temporary parking spaces in closer proximity to the accessible entrance. During the local Davidson County election in August 2023, DRT re-surveyed the sites previously flagged for inadequate accessible parking. At this time, DRT found that the county was utilizing the cones as reported to bring accessible parking closer to the entrance, although at some sites, cones were not set up in a manner to allow for a temporary space and an access aisle. DRT will provide additional guidance to the county administrator of elections on more effective use of these temporary measures prior to the 2024 election cycle. 
In Shelby county, DRT surveyed 44 sites and identified multiple sites with inadequate accessible and van accessible parking, many of which also lacked a passenger drop off area, making access even more difficult. There were also multiple sites where surveyors found interior doors that were too heavy. In response to DRT’s advocacy efforts, Shelby County re-surveyed all sites identified as having significant accessibility issues and remedied the accessibility barriers identified either through the permanent or temporary solutions and by moving a handful of sites to more accessible locations. 
In Knox County, DRT surveyed 40 sites and similarly found parking accessibility to be the most significant county trend where accessible parking was not in close proximity to the entrance. Some locations also included inaccessible/inadequate ramps and lifts. The election commission was very receptive to DRT’s recommendations and committed to contacting Davidson County to get information about purchasing similar collapsible cones. They also re-assigned one of the poll sites where accessibility issues were too significant for temporary improvements. Additionally, the commission posted information about inaccessible sites to inform the general public about processes for voting at an alternative location. 
In Williamson County, DRT surveyed 12 polling locations. Williamson now utilizes convenience voting centers allowing voters to vote at any designated voting center. While physical accessibility of the sites was generally suitable, DRT observed sites with significant overcrowding, long lines, and extended wait times which created accessibility challenges for many voters. In response to these findings, the Williamson County Election Commission will be creating two-three additional voting centers to address overcrowding. 
DRT identified similar but less significant parking barriers in Montgomery county and reported these findings to the county administrator. They agreed to survey these sites and explore temporary measures to bring accessible parking closer to the entrance. Surveys in Hamilton County did not indicate accessibility issues that need to be addressed at this time. 
While DRT’s primary advocacy efforts were focused on working with individual counties this year to remedy barriers at the local level, this pattern in violations indicates a need for future statewide improvements as well. DRT requested that the TN Secretary of State’s Division of Elections update the guidance provided to counties to include specific language to ensure that accessible parking is in close proximity to the accessible entrance. DRT voting staff regularly conducts independent voting rights workshops, outreach, and training activities designed to educate people with disabilities, their family members, support professionals, and partner agencies working to create equitable elections. The purpose of these efforts is to ensure that voters with disabilities are empowered with information about the voting processes, their voting rights, and how to effectively self-advocate when they encounter barriers in the voting process. Voters with disabilities are more likely to experience difficulties while voting and information about elections and candidates is often not available in accessible formats or plain language that can be understood by all voters. As such, DRT developed and carried out a robust training and outreach plan to bring accessible information to voters who are historically unserved or underserved in our state and to also train other organizations on how to make their efforts more inclusive of voters with disabilities. 
In FY2023, DRT continued the work from the previous year to provide training to new or first-time voters attending High School or post-secondary inclusive programs at colleges and universities across the state. This year, DRT held voting rights training sessions and an opportunity for voter registration for students at the Tennessee School for the Deaf, Next Steps at Vanderbilt and the Futures Program at UT Knoxville. The voting team will continue to expand this college-focused program across the state. Additionally, DRT trained young adults receiving vocational rehabilitation services in Paris, TN, a cohort of students with Vanderbilt’s Educate 2 Advocate program, and adults with disabilities at the Center for Independent Living in a rural TN county.
The voting team also expanded efforts to include a new underserved population of voters in county jails. While project activities are covered in more detail in a separate project, it should be noted that DRT partnered with the Free the Vote Coalition and the Davidson County Sheriffs office to conduct voting rights training and voter registration activities in the Davidson County Jail. Over the course of a week, DRT spoke to over 200 individuals and registered 48. This outreach also included education about available voting accommodations and targeted support to advocate for individuals who expressed needing assistance in the voting process. 
DRT also engaged in multiple outreach activities where individuals received information about PAVA and voting rights and registration. The voting team disseminated information across two county mayoral forums for voters who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, multiple transition fairs, the TN Mega Conference, and delivered accessibility specific information to election officials and civic engagement groups at the TN Democracy Project Conference.
DRT also focused on raising awareness of partner organizations to build their capacity to assist voters with disabilities. DRT continued its collaboration with CivicTN, the state table for civic engagement and trained partners organizations as well as a group of Youth Fellows working with the coalition on three different occasions. Topics included poll site accessibility, information accessibility, barriers to voting, and general disability voting rights. 
Finally, DRT developed new voting materials and resources, assisted the US Vote Foundation in developing a TN specific online voter guide for voters with disabilities, and worked with a national coalition to spread awareness and train other groups on how to conduct poll site accessibility surveys.
Across all of these efforts, DRT provided outreach materials and training to over 550 individuals and helped 61 individuals register to vote. 39.47% of the DRT’s documented outreach activities highlighted the voting program or offered information related to voting across 45 events total.",,,,,
UT,2020,"IMPACTING POSITIVE VOTING STATUTE FOR ELECTIONS HELD DURING THE PANDEMIC:  The legislature met for a special session to consider issues and government activities impacted by Covid-19 and the need for social distancing.  Due to our advocacy and technical assistance efforts, the final version of the bill included provisions for voters with disabilities who have difficulty reading or marking a paper ballot independently, to access accommodations for voting.  In some areas, accommodation options were expanded to fit the unique needs of the voter, rather than the one choice of voting on a ballot marking device at the county clerk’s office.  A few counties began offering electronic ballot transmittal and some would deliver a ballot marking device to the voter’s home.  We were also successful in adding a requirement that each county must inform voters about the availability of accommodations and how to access them through: the county website, public notices, and with the mailed ballots.

ADVISED VOTING OFFICIALS THROUGH ACCESSIBILITY TASK FORCE: Invited to join the County Clerks Association Taskforce to develop guidance for the upcoming election, we sent written recommendations regarding voting to all county clerks.  The State supported our position on every point, including the practice of offering accommodations to voters with print disabilities during the full period that other voters have access to their printed ballot, not just on Election Day.   Through continued communication efforts prior to the election, we discovered that some counties only planned to offer accommodations on Election Day, reasoning that the Legislature had eliminated early voting for this election.  Our PAVA team drafted a letter that was sent to the State Elections Office.  We asserted that offering accessible voting options over an extended period is an appropriate accommodation under the ADA.  The State agreed and committed to providing this training to the clerks. 

VOTER REGISTRATION IN CARE FACILITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC:  We promoted voter registration within care facilities by developing and distributing voter information to recreation directors.  Our voter registration binder included information about the National Voter Registration Act, HAVA, and the ADA.  We provided Utah-specific voter registration information as well as registration and absentee ballot request forms.  In many cases, we also walked through the registration process with care facility staff and answered their questions.  In all, we reached staff from 15 assisted living and care facilities.  This is an ongoing project that we hope to expand during the coming year.

ACCESSIBLE PARTY CONVENTIONS:  We developed resources for political parties planning caucus meetings and conventions.  The information was well-received when we met with party leaders.  

VOTING COMMUNICATIONS 
Our voting team examined the communication practices of each county in Utah.  Specifically, we looked at website accessibility and content.  While the websites were generally accessible with a screen reader, the information on accommodations and other accessibility info were either absent or difficult to find.  We also looked at general voting information such as early voting, same-day voter registration, dropbox and vote center locations, how to access accommodations, and; the availability of accessible voting equipment.  Beyond the website information, we looked at press releases sent, social media posts, information mailed with or separately from the ballot, posts at government and community buildings, etc.  Once the information was compiled, our findings were disappointing in many areas such as efforts to communicate with voters about accommodations, voting machines, and accessible features.  Many counties did not even have current election dates and information on their website.  We sent a report to the State Elections Office and each county clerk.  It is also available in the original and an accessible format for the public to review on our website. Some counties responded by requesting our technical assistance to improve their websites.  Other communication issues were improved when we worked with legislative sponsors to develop temporary voting statutes for elections impacted by Covid-19.",,,,,
UT,2023,"Training
Participated as a panelist during an accessible technology session at a summit attended by local, county and state governments to educate government leaders on the importance of providing accessible electronic formats and explain the impact that accessible technology has on citizens with disabilities. Provided information about federal accessibility standards and resources available that governments can use to improve accessibility of digital formats. Taught 24 attendees about web access.

In a presentation at the Utah Association of Counties (UAC) Conference, the DLC shared the findings of our ballot drop box study with 48 county clerks and election administrators.  We provided suggestions for overcoming the most common access problems and offered technical support as counties make choices about electronic ballot delivery, voting accommodations including signature verification, and ballot box and vote center access.  A DLC voting advocate also met with newly elected county clerks in 9 counties. We provided information about the DLC’s PAVA program and offered technical assistance to support them with preparing for an accessible election.  We also met with new election team members in Millard, Beaver, Garfield, Tooele, Wasatch and Summit counties providing requested technical assistance.

Staff met with election administrators in eleven counties (Kane, Wayne, Piute, Sevier, Salt Lake, Rich, Duchesne, Wasatch, Uintah, Carbon, and Cache) during the General Election voting period.  We provided feedback about vote center accessibility and suggestions for changes that would align the voting experience with federal accessibility standards. We also provided information about accessibility standards to town hall personnel at 12 locations.

We met with the election team and the new county clerk in Salt Lake County providing feedback to them regarding our ballot box access reviews during the 2022 election season.  We also provided recommendations for improving the accessibility of the ballot marking device.  The team was very receptive, and we look forward to a more collaborative approach to voting preparations with the county in the future. (6)

Overall, we trained 216 election administrators and poll workers.

We want residents of care facilities to have full access to casting their ballot. Care facilities receiving Medicaid funding will regularly assist residents with voter registration. They may also provide information as appropriate about accessible voting equipment options or the availability of electronic ballots. We educated care facility staff re: their responsibilities under the National Voter Registration Act. The materials and instruction that we provided include information about: Voter registration, absentee ballots, accessible voting equipment and electronic ballot options, suggestions about how care facilities can help residents access voting equipment. We trained 29 assisted living facility staff during 3 presentations (1 rural).

Electronic Voting
The DLC's voting access director provided technical assistance throughout a successful RFP process to select a web-based ballot-marking and delivery system. During Utah's recently completed primary and general elections Utahns with print and other disabilities were able to use their own devices to vote privately and independently from home for the first time. The 2023 Utah elections landscape called for timely responses to attacks on fundamental voting options while pushing forward to expand voting accommodations. Our PAVA team has enjoyed tremendous success in these areas during the past year while continuing to support voters with disabilities as they engage in the electoral process.

STATE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINTS
The following state complaints were submitted by our PAVA team.

SRID# 2234770
Funding Source: PAVA
The DLC submitted a Help America Vote Act (HAVA) complaint on behalf of a client who requested the use of the audio ballot at a Salt Lake County vote center. Unfortunately, poll workers were unable to operate the accessible features of the ballot marking device. Instead, they insisted on reading the ballot aloud, asking the voter to announce her voting choices, and marking the ballot for her. As a result of our complaint, the State Elections Office (SEO) issued an apology, required Salt Lake County to work with the DLC to obtain technical assistance regarding setting up a polling place, provide copies of their training materials to the SEO and the DLC, participate in training that the DLC provided to election administrators across the State, and; contact the voter named in the complaint and a past complainant to ensure that their needs have been addressed. Salt Lake County did comply with these requests and the DLC was able to provide technical assistance regarding how to prepare signage and website information to ensure that the site is more accessible. We also reviewed the poll worker training manual and visited the County during their “Practice makes Perfect” training day. During our November Early Voting visits to the site, we found that all signage suggestions had been implemented. However, according to a complaint from a voter who visited the polling place during the general election, the poll workers still did not know how to initiate the audio ballot when needed.


SRID # 1047203
Funding Source: PAVA
The DLC submitted a HAVA complaint on behalf of the client after she experienced difficulties when voting in-person at a Washington County vote center.   The client has low vision as well as two neurological diseases.  She contacted the county prior to voting to ensure that the accessible options would meet her needs and was reassured that the vote center equipment would be adequate. When she arrived to vote, the text size on the machine was too small and she was not offered the audio option.   In order to vote, she had to crouch in a painful squat to see the screen.  Because of the positioning of the voting device, she was concerned that other voters and poll workers were witnessing her voting choices.
The State Elections Office responded to our complaint by agreeing to all of our resolution requests. They also committed to ensuring that Washington County provides poll workers with proper training prior to the next election.  Further, the State confirmed that they are in the procurement process for obtaining an electronic ballot delivery system so that voters with print disabilities may vote at home using their own device.

SYSTEMIC ADVOCACY
We had tremendously successful outcomes in the area of systemic advocacy this year. By educating policy makers and collaborating with other voting stakeholders, new policies and accommodations were secured for Utah voters with disabilities.

Signature Match Statute
With our advocacy and support, two bills were passed during the legislative session which allow accommodations for voters whose signature with their ballot is unlikely to match because of their disability.  Utah votes by mail.  Therefore, a voters signature on the mailed ballot serves as a verification of identity when compared with signatures retained electronically from the voter registration form and past elections. When a voter's ballot is involved in the cure process because of a signature problem, the ballot isn't counted until the voter signs an affidavit confirming that he/she voted the ballot.  Now, because of the new language in statute, that sworn statement includes a section that allows a voter to initiate a request for an accommodation that would apply in future elections.  This process ensures that a voter who’s disability impacts their ability to sign their name consistently will not be repeatedly subject to the cure process and that an alternative means of verifying the voter's identity is put in place. 

Attacks on Vote by Mail and Voter Registration
Through our work with the Let Utah Vote Coalition, we joined with other organizations to defend voting access during the legislative session.  Bills surfaced that once again attacked vote by mail and voter registration options.  We tracked progress on these bills, spoke to bill sponsors about their impact on voters with disabilities and provided information to those providing testimony when requested.  Those bills failed.

Electronic Ballot Delivery
DLC staff participated in the State’s electronic ballot delivery RFP committee.  A vendor was chosen, and the contract finalized.  The State Elections Office has secured funding for the first two years.  This is an incredible step forward for voting access in Utah. Our advocacy plan without a lawsuit was successful. Through persistent efforts to educate election administrators about the rights of voters with disabilities to an equal voting experience and by collaborating with community advocates, every voter in Utah can now vote privately and independently at home. 

Defending Vote by Mail
Through our work with the Let Utah Vote Coalition, we joined with other organizations to defend voting access during the legislative session.  Bills surfaced that once again attacked vote by mail and voter registration options.  We tracked progress on these bills, spoke to bill sponsors about their impact on voters with disabilities and provided information to partners who testified in committee meetings.

IMPROVING PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY 
Ballot Drop Box Access
The DLC staff collected data on 181 drop boxes in 26 counties which concluded an Election 2022 effort to assess 291 drop boxes in every (29) Utah county.  The data was compiled and a report, “Utah’s Ballot Boxes, An Accessibility Study” was completed and distributed to election administrators across the State.  Some of the primary findings were:  
• 58% of the 291 boxes evaluated were not accessible,
• 27% of parking locations failed,
• 33% had route violations,
• 34% failed because of the positioning or method in which the box was installed,
• 88% of ramps were inadequate,
Since the release of our state-wide report, we have also sent individual reports to 23 of Utah’s 29 counties.  County reports detail our findings at each drop box location within a county.  The reports show pictures and provide suggestions for resolving access issues. As a result of these reports and our efforts to establish relationships with election administrators in every county, we have provided requested technical assistance at 28 locations. 

Vote Center Accessibility
24 vote centers in 16 counties were assessed during the primary election season.   Feedback was provided to county personnel on our findings so that they may make adjustments prior to the general election. 


EDUCATING ELECTION ADMINSTRATORS AND POLL WORKERS
Presentations to Election Administrators
During the Fiscal Year, PAVA provided training to 216 poll workers and election administrators. The following provides details about the training efforts.
1)  Staff met with election administrators in eleven counties during the November 2022 General Election voting period.  We provided feedback about vote center accessibility and suggestions for changes that would align the voting experience with federal accessibility standards. We also provided information about accessibility standards to town hall personnel at 12 locations.
2)  In a presentation at the Utah Association of Counties (UAC) Conference, the DLC shared the findings of our ballot drop box study with 48 county clerks and election administrators.  We provided suggestions for overcoming the most common access problems and offered technical support as counties make choices about electronic ballot delivery, voting accommodations including signature verification, and ballot box and vote center access.  
3)  In 2023, the DLC voting advocate met with each of the nine newly elected county clerks and their staff.  We provided information about the DLC’s PAVA program and offered technical assistance to support them with preparing for an accessible election.  
4)  Town personnel at 12 locations where voters deposit a ballot were provided with information about access shortfalls and how to amend them.
5)  77 poll workers received feedback regarding the accessibility of the voting area during our visits to polling places.

EDUCATING VOTERS

Education & Training
The DLC educated 774 voters and potential voters through education activities including: 
• 18 voting trainings reaching 348 potential voters.  Group presentations included: post-high programs, Parkinson’s support groups, Centers for Independent Living consumer groups, assisted living centers, National Federation of the Blind Conference, Digital Government Summit, Disability Rights Action Committee, Utah Assistive Living Council, PAIMI Advisory Council, etc.  Voter registration assistance was offered at each presentation.
• PAVA provided voting rights information and voter registration opportunities at community events such as: Ferina Latina de Recursos, Stronger Together Events (for Medicaid recipients), Transition Fairs sponsored by school districts, and other community events.
• Registered voters at the Utah State Hospital do not have access to ballot and candidate information through typical means such as news stories and the internet.  Prior to the 2022 general election then again prior to the August 2023 primary, the DLC provided a booklet to five USH units about candidates and issues on the ballot for individuals who are registered to vote as residents at USH.

Media & Social Media
1974 voters were reached through 4 “Policy Corner” videos, 1 blog post and 14 social media posts.


STAFF TRAINING
Voting team members participated in 12 voting focused training webinars.  Many were sponsored by the National Disability Rights Network. They included trainings on: surveying polling places, managing data, accessible voting methods, outreach, State voting rights, investigative tools, ADA enforcement, cultural aspects of Native American heritage, etc.",,,,,
VA,2020,"Sharing Information

dLCV distributed 489 voter information business cards when participating in various dLCV outreach events and facilitating educational trainings. 

We also sent mailings to all 78 Registrar offices across the Commonwealth of Virginia addressing systemic concerns with statewide curbside voting issues. We created a fact sheet on the topic and distributed it in advance of both elections to educate them about proper procedures for curbside voting for the public.

Volunteers Assemble! 

dLCV created an online survey for volunteers to use for surveying polling sites. dLCV provided training to prepare volunteers for doing the survey work. Between both elections, we had one hundred twenty (120) volunteers participate in surveying precincts in Richmond, Roanoke, King George County and Blacksburg.

Let’s Hit the Polls

Using our staff and volunteers, dLCV surveyed more than 300 polling sites for physical accessibility during the November 2019 and March 2020 elections. In the November election, dLCV also re-surveyed 18 locations identified in prior elections with accessibility issues.  On Super Tuesday, we surveyed 25 new locations and 15 previously problematic locations. The most frequent issue we encountered is no signage for parking and curbside voting.  dLCV sent corrective action letters to the registrars who had accessibility issues in their localities, and 10 registrars have agreed to make the needed changes.

Educating the Public 

Following successful litigation we brought using other funding, dLCV educated the public about our suit which successfully argued that the failure of Virginia to provide an accessible way for persons with print disabilities to vote absentee in a private manner violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Once the order came down, it required Virginia to provide a ballot which can be delivered and completed electronically. 
We then utilized PAVA to communicate with Registrars and on how to they planned to create and distribute the ballots. We also received 4 complaints from the community and monitored their situations to ensure they in fact received their accessible ballots. All of the individuals we followed did in fact receive accessible ballots. We are continuing to utilize PAVA to provide education and outreach on the case to the public which benefits approximately 178,000 Virginians with visual disabilities. 

Getting the Word Out

dLCV incorporated PAVA voting rights training in multiple outreach and training activities throughout the year to many groups of parents, students, veterans, and advocates. The groups included: Endependence Centers in Arlington and Norfolk, William and Mary, parents groups in Danville and Charlottesville, the Community Services Board (CSB) state conference, Denbigh House, Bridgeline Place, Kenmore Club, MillHouse, Lewis B. Puller, Jr. Veterans Benefits Clinic, Virginia Veterans Care Center, Mason Veterans and Service members Legal Clinic, VDVS Henrico Benefits Office, Virginia Department of Veterans Services (VDVS) Virginia Veterans and Family Services, and Department for Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS) Military and Veterans Affairs. 

One particularly noteworthy training at the Virginia Board’s Training Alumni Association urged the participants to survey their polling places and covered multiple topics including Virginia’s practices regarding curbside voting as well.  The Training Alumni Association offered a statement in opposition to Virginia’s statement that a person seeking to vote curbside must bring a “helper” with them.  A member of the Department of Elections was also on the presentation, and he promised to change that statement on the website as soon as possible. We received a response on the issue in early FY 21 and will report the outcome in next year’s PPR. 362 people viewed the event on Facebook Live and an additional 30 persons via zoom.  
We reached over 1,892 attendees over the course of these trainings!

dLCV provided case services for 5 individuals this fiscal year on a variety of issues including voting absentee, accessible ballots, and general education about the right to vote. Here are two examples:

Puzzle Solved

Ms. Perez is an individual with a disability who is also Latino. She reached out to dLCV from a dLCV presentation and conversation on a Hispanic radio station. She had questions about her voting rights, voting absentee and how to effectively understand the process. dLCV carefully walked her through the entire process and helped her reach the polls confidently to cast her vote!

Let’s Figure this Out

Beth is a Virginia resident who contacted dLCV with questions about how to access new absentee ballot options for voters with a print disability. dLCV reviewed the new guidelines from the Virginia Board of Elections we helped to create regarding how she should be able to access a print-disability accessible ballot and detailed instructions on how to complete and submit it. Beth expressed concern that her local registrar office does not know anything about these new rules and that they have not even received her original absentee ballot mailed out weeks ago. Using this knowledge, she can vote using new print-accessible ballot options in November.

In FY 20, dLCV created 9 voting rights publications we used to promote the PAVA program and early efforts to advocate for voter education in advance of the November 2020 election. These publications included: a new voting brochure explaining how to vote and general voting accessibility requirements, a voting laws 2020 fact sheet, an exercising your right to vote fact sheet, ID requirements 2020 fact sheet, and an absentee voting fact sheet explaining what absentee voting is, how to vote absentee, and the changes to absentee voting in 2020. Staff utilized these publications in voter education visits to Assisted Living Facilities and many other community groups in the fourth quarter and beginning of FY 21.
Next Year’s PAVA PPR will provide a complete report of the impact of these numerous outreach activities to support the November 2020 election.",,,,,
VT,2020,"DRVT staff has continued to work closely with the Vermont Secretary of State’s Election Division (SOS) on areas including educating the public and voting officials about the rights of voters with disabilities, accessible voting technology, disability etiquette and resources to assist voters with disabilities. DRVT’s collaboration with the SOS Election Divisions has been helpful by increasing the exposure, through the SOS Elections Division, of our voting support and services to even more Vermonters than we would be able to reach without the SOS’s support.

With important financial support and planning input from the Vermont Secretary of State’s (SOS) Elections Division, DRVT initiated a Focus Group Project to learn more about existing barriers to voting faced by Vermonters with disabilities as part of our continuing mission to increase voting access among Vermonters with disabilities. The Focus Group Project was intended to identify whether previous efforts to improve access and turn out have been effective, as well as to identify new proposed solutions people with disabilities themselves recommend to eliminate the existing barriers to voting. DRVT contacted various disability-related organizations around the state to obtain their assistance and convened 10 Focus Groups in FY20. There were 126 participants representing many individuals with a wide variety of disabilities, gender identities, ethnicities including refugees for whom English was a second language, and of different socio-economic statuses.

The aforementioned DRVT work on polling place accessibility surveys and the collaboration with our SOS and town clerks are examples of the work DRVT did with Vermont and local voting officials. Regarding accessibility surveys, DRVT staff continued to work with local officials to identify effective remedies to inadequacies identified by the access surveys.

DRVT worked with the VT SOS office a for our PAVA Focus Group project from. DRVT staff had several email, telephone, and zoom consultations with SOS Elections Division staff prior to the August Primary Election and leading up the November General Election to help develop and disseminate accessible voting materials and remedy issues of concern regarding new voting processes as a result of COVID-19. 

DRVT staff created and distributed a Non-Partisan Voter's Guide for People with Disabilities, providing information and education on voting rights, electoral processes, and candidates running for office to individuals with disabilities and the general public throughout Vermont.

WI,2020,"Goal 7: Protect the rights of people with disabilities in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

Everything was made more difficult in FY 2020 because of COVID.

The COVID-19 outbreak presented us with many opportunities for systemic and individual advocacy. The principal part of state government responsible for policy regarding access to COVID treatments and vaccinations was the Department of Health Services’ State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee-SDMAC. Many of our activities were directed at that entity. 

Priority 1: Prevent discrimination against people with IDD and other disabilities in rationing and other policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Litigation

Wisconsin Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et., al., v Tony Evers, et., al., 2020 AP 687-OA:  One of several plaintiffs in original action before Supreme Court of Wisconsin requesting emergency relief of appointment of special master to help reduce the prison population through early or conditional release at high risk for contracting Covid-19.

Case Example

Assisted a woman with autism obtain job coaching services through a new provider after her former support agency abruptly dropped her due to COVID. Client was able to maintain her employment at an essential business throughout the pandemic. 

Other Advocacy

State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee (SDMAC).  Early in the pandemic DHS convened its SDMAC to address policy issues related to the pandemic. The first issue addressed was the possibility that ventilators would have to be rationed. DRW monitored all meetings of the SDMAC on behalf of ourselves and the Survival Coalition as the Committee discussed the possibility of creating statewide rationing policies. We submitted multiple letters to the Committee Chair and the DHS Secretary offering comments on various aspects of the SDMAC’s make-up and its deliberations. We were successful in advocating for the addition of two members to the Committee who possessed expertise in disability in general and IDD in particular, including the Director of the UCEDD and a nurse who specialized in advocating for  people with IDD when they required hospitalization. The disability perspective was entirely lacking in the initial membership of the SDMAC. We also commented whenever the Committee issued draft policy or guidance, weighing in extensively on the various proposals for rationing ventilators.  Ultimately, the SDMAC abandoned the attempt to issue prescriptive policy on how hospitals could allocate ventilators and opted for a statement of general guidance applicable to ventilators and other treatments that might become available and might be scarce. The final guidance reflected many of the priorities DRW advocated and did not include several draft principles we had objected to.

Letters to Wisconsin Hospitals:  After failure of SDMAC to issue definitive policy on ventilator allocation, DRW wrote to every hospital in Wisconsin (127 total) explaining how they could avoid discriminating against people with disabilities if they found it necessary to ration ventilators. Letter was needed because DHS did not issue guidance on how to ration (see above).  Letter also addressed visitation issue-accommodations from COVID visit restrictions in order to accommodate patients with disabilities-particularly those with communication disorders. 

SDMAC Ethics Subcommittee. DHS subcommittee of State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee (SDMAC) tasked with developing an ethical framework for guiding DHS in developing distribution priorities for COVID vaccines and therapeutics.  DRW representative appointed to represent the disability perspective at twice-weekly meetings for six weeks. Ethical principles adopted by the subcommittee reflected a clear and unequivocal statement of nondiscrimination based on disability in the final framework.  This was adopted because DRW was on the subcommittee.  Early versions of the statement of nondiscrimination initially omitted disability, then made it conditional.  Final version placed disability on equal level with other protected classes (race, age, religion, etc.). Subcommittee was tasked with ensuring that ethical principles would also address issues of health inequities in underserved populations. 

Maskless NEMT drivers:  DRW complained to DHS after receiving several complaints from people who were being assigned to nonemergency medical transport (NEMT) drivers who were ignoring mask requirements when transporting people to and from medical appointments  DHS agreed that NEMT drivers could be required to wear masks and other PPE while transporting NEMT patients.  DHS amended contract with statewide NEMT contractor.

ABA Therapy Provider Misconduct: Contacted DHS Medicaid prior authorization unit to 
complain about major Behavioral Treatment provider using COVID outbreak as a reason to terminate children from their program and replace them with children from their waitlist who were not concerned with the risk of virus transmission.  If a family attempted to suspend in-home therapy due to COVID, provider was issuing termination notices and telling families they could seek services as new clients when they wanted to resume service.  But the provider has a waitlist for services, meaning there would likely be a significant delay in resuming services once the pandemic passed.  DHS issued letter to provider advising them to cease practice of terminating clients who sought to protect themselves from spread of virus. Family that anonymously complained and caused our DHS contact was able to negotiate a resolution with provider following issuance of DHS letter.

DD Center PPE Complaint: Followed upon anonymous complaint that D Center was insufficiently supplied with PPE in early stage of pandemic. Center responded with evidence that it had sufficient PPE to maintain safe operation. 

Isolation Policies: Reviewed and commented on three DHS isolation policies: FDD/SNF; Mental Health Facilities; Secure treatment and correctional facilities.
 
Priority 2: Ensure students with disabilities are provided with a Free Appropriate Public Education during school closures and in the virtual learning environment.

Case example

Represented fifteen-year-old student with an intellectual disability who was unable to wear a mask due to sensory issues related to her disability. School district was providing 2 days in person and 3 days of virtual instruction. But District wanted parents to sign a waiver of FAPE due to student’s inability to wear a mask.  DRW advised against signing waiver of FAPE rights. Met with student’s Special Ed team to ensure that parents’ concerns were heard and team collaborated on suitable solution. The parents and Special Ed team arrived at suitable learning environment arrangement for student which provided 3 days virtual with classmates per week; 2 days work on her own from home; 5 days of school total. No FAPE waiver signed. Student was permitted to ease into doing days in-person at school if she wants.

Other Advocacy

Racine Unified School district COVID-19 Reentry Plan: Participated in planning for re-entry back into school to ensure special education students individual needs are considered along with safety for students.  Creating a plan for in-person learning, virtual learning and a hybrid model. DRW was involved in the planning for the following workgroups: Flexible Scheduling, Technology, Instructional Framework, and Special Education. Students were offered in-person learning when necessary as well as AT for students who required it in the virtual platform, support and accommodations for students during all virtual and hybrid models.

Priority 3: Ensure people with disabilities' access to the right to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2020 elections held during the pandemic created new challenges, as many people with disabilities have high vulnerability for COVID 19 and were reluctant to vote at their polling place.  Social distancing also reduced opportunities for DRW to provide in person assistance with voter registration, photo ID requirements, and education about voter rights and resources.  DRW recalibrated our PAVA work to protect the rights of people with disabilities during the pandemic, as noted below.  

This work was done in partnership with:

• The Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition (DVC), a cross disability coalition that includes disability and aging agencies, and self advocates, coordinated by DRW and the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities. Key partners include the 8 Independent Living Centers, WI Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired, Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging, People First Wisconsin, and NAMI Wisconsin and affiliates, and the League of Women Voters WI.

• Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition.  A coalition of voting rights, civil rights, and other agencies that emerged in response to the challenges of voting during the pandemic and increased our capacity to reach communities of color.

We identified the following priorities related to COVID-19:

• Ensure people with disabilities' access to the right to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic and advocate for safe voting policies.

• Provide training and support materials for service providers, including direct care providers and care facilities, to support their members to safely assert their voting rights during the pandemic, and in the absence of Special Voting Deputies.    

Activities to support these priorities:

• Provided COVID related testimony and recommendations to the Wisconsin Election Commission five times to address voting rights, accessibility, and public health concerns during the pandemic.  DRW provided ongoing consultation to/ and with WEC staff on a weekly basis.  Voting in care facilities was an area of particular concern given the high vulnerability of residents to COVID 19 and restrictions on outsiders entering care facilities.  DRW worked with WEC to provide input on training and reference materials to facility staff, and also partnered on providing virtual trainings that were promoted to facility staff.  Planned polling place accessibility audits conducted by WEC and DRW were cancelled due to the pandemic.  DRW worked with WEC to develop other strategies to address accessibility.  This included updating the DRW Accessibility Checklist which is posted on the WEC website; provision of free accessibility supplies such as signature guides; van accessible signs; wireless doorbells for curbside voting, and curbside voting signage; ne guidance on Wisconsin’s requirements for curbside voting s, provide info about absentee voting; and input on training content for poll workers and clerks.  DRW and other disability advocates were speakers for the WEC webinar for municipal clerks on Polling Place Set-up, which addressed a range of accessibility and accommodation issues.  482 individuals viewed the webinar. 

• The DRW Voter Hotline saw a significant increase in calls for assistance from voters with disabilities, family members and providers who were concerned about voting safely during COVID.  A high percentage of contacts requested assistance with absentee voting.  The Milwaukee Election Commission provided DRW Voter Hotline information on their mails which resulted in a high call volume from Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s most diverse community with the greatest number of people with disabilities.

• Developed and/or updated 10 voting fact sheets to include information about safe voting during the pandemic, and the frequent COVID related changes in voting.  Materials were available on our website, Facebook page, and mailed at no charge to community members and agencies.  We used new methods to distribute materials – for example “Make Your Plan to Vote” was included in food boxes distributed by the Hunger Task Force and by an independent living center.

• Since in-person trainings and outreach events could not be offered during the pandemic, we offered virtual training events, and also developed a series of videos about how to vote safely. Dozens of training and outreach events reached thousands of people with disabilities and their allies.  The 7 new videos, as well as videos of some trainings were available on our website, social media and shared by coalition partners.
• Since our ability to directly reach voters was limited by the pandemic, we launched a new initiative, “Voting in the Time of Pandemic” to train more services providers including Aging and Disability Resource Center staff, long term care providers, residential providers including nursing home staff, and mental health providers.  Training and resources were also provided to staff at psychiatric and IDD facilities operated by the state of Wisconsin.  Because voting was now a public health issue, service providers were encouraged to assist their residents and members to vote safely.  During the reporting period, 17 trainings were held to inform providers about how to support members with voting safely.  Thousands of providers participated.  

• To inform voters and service providers during the pandemic, we increased the frequency and reach of the DVC e-newsletter.  During the reporting period, 18 issues were released that addressed COVID related concerns.  The e-newsletter reaches thousands of services providers, community partners, and voters.  In addition to the DVC email list, the e-newsletters are shared by the Department of Health Services (DHS) to their listservs (over 11,000 people), the Wisconsin Aging Network, and the Mental Health Task Force / Make It Work Milwaukee listservs, BPDD, and other coalition partners.

• COVID-19 increased barriers for people with disabilities to obtain a photo ID for voting.  DMV offices were closed due to the pandemic and open by appointment only.  Limited access to transportation, especially lift equipped transportation, has been an ongoing barrier to obtaining photo ID; the need to isolate during the pandemic further exacerbated transportation barriers.  DRW worked with the Dept. of Transportation and the Governor’s office to elevate the need to expand access to options to obtain photo ID.

DRW increased awareness of voting rights and safe voting through media coverage during the pandemic.  Two press events were held; nine press statements were released that related to voting and the pandemic, and nine media stories included DRW perspectives regarding COVID and voting. Priority 1: Assist people with disabilities to exercise their rights under the law to fully participate in the electoral process. 

The reporting period included four statewide elections: February, April, and August, as well as outreach, training, and policy advocacy in advance of the November election.  The 2020 elections held during the pandemic created new challenges, as many people with disabilities have high vulnerability for COVID 19 and were reluctant to vote at their polling place.  Social distancing also reduced opportunities for DRW to provide in person assistance with voter registration, photo ID requirements, and education about voter rights and resources.  Finally, the process for voting, especially absentee voting, changed repeatedly as a result of litigation and evolving guidance.  DRW recalibrated our PAVA work to protect the rights of people with disabilities during the pandemic, as explained in this narrative.  

This work was done in partnership with:

*The Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition (DVC), a cross disability coalition that includes disability and aging agencies, and self advocates, coordinated by DRW and the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities. Key coalition partners include the 8 Independent Living Centers, WI Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired, Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging, People First Wisconsin, NAMI Wisconsin and affiliates, and the League of Women Voters WI, in addition to DRW and BPDD.

*Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition.  A coalition of voting rights, civil rights, and other agencies that emerged in response to the challenges of voting during the pandemic and increased our capacity to reach communities of color.  Key members include All Voting Is Local, ACLU, Common Cause, Souls to the Polls, Wisconsin Faith Voices for Justice, Voces de la Frontera, League of Woman Voters of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Conservation Voices, Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, and others.  


Provide direct assistance and education to voters with disabilities regarding voter registration, absentee voting, casting a ballot at their polling place, and voter rights including development of a new video training curriculum.  

The DRW Voter Hotline is open year round.  Call volume during the reporting period was higher than usual for the April and August elections, largely in part due to barriers caused by COVID and confusion about change in voting law/ guidance.  Absentee voting related calls were especially high with confusion about how to request an absentee ballot, struggles with the process for uploading photo ID or lack of photo ID, challenges with the witness requirement, and ballots that were late arriving.  Callers included providers  and case managers seeking guidance and resources on how to help their members/ residents to vote.  We also received a number of calls from people with questions about guardianship and voting. For those voting in person, topics included the need for, or denial of accommodations such as curbside voting or assistance with completing a ballot; changes in polling places, long lines, communication challenges, transportation, and major confusion during the April election.  DRW also received referrals from other voter hotlines, including Souls to the Polls, and we worked together with our coalition partners, as well as WEC and local clerks to meet voter needs.  In addition, we received some referrals from Wisconsin Election Protection and from the network of on site observers coordinated by LWV.  We were able to obtain information to support our callers from the on-site observers. 


Outreach and Training

From October 1 – mid March, DRW conducted in-person outreach and training events, reaching approximately 2865 people.  After mid-March, we shifted to virtual events using the Zoom and Facebook live platforms to reach over 2000 people, as well as sharing information on our Facebook and the DVC website, and providing information by mail.  For example, in advance of the April election, we provided three Zoom events on the topic “Voting and COVID 19: Learn the Latest.” Training stressed voting safely during the pandemic voting rights and accommodations, and updates on changing law and practice.  Regular virtual updates were provided to People First Wisconsin, the BPDD Living Well self-advocates and agencies, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, long term care agencies, the Mental Health Task Force, and independent living centers.

To support voters and providers with voting during the pandemic, a number of new videos were developed and shared on our website, Facebook, and promoted in our email newsletter.  Topics included the following:  
*“Consider Becoming a Poll Worker” to encourage more voters with disabilities to serve as poll workers, how poll workers with disabilities can contribute to creating a welcoming accessible voting experience.  
*Wisconsin Youth Voices on voting, featuring youth with disabilities encouraging other youth to vote.
*Absentee voting:  how to videos as well as video from voter with a disability
*A series of videos on the ADA 30th featuring Wisconsinites with a disability reflecting on the impact of the ADA including on voting rights, and the continued challenges to accessibility, including the need for an accessible absentee ballot. 
*2020 election instruction video series.  A series of 5 instructional videos on the following topics: Absentee Voting, People First Voting Basics, Voter Registration and Photo ID, In-Person Voting, Voting Rights.

The DVC developed and distributed a new poster to increase awareness in the disability community of the 2020 elections and of voting resources.  The poster features 4 of our Voter Spotlights  - Wisconsinites with disabilities sharing why they vote.  
DRW redesigned the Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition website (https://disabilityvote.org/) to provide full accessibility and a new look, with updated content.  All coalition fact sheets and videos are posted on the website, as is the DVC e-newsletter, policy updates, and current news.

Our postcard campaign continued with free postcards available in English and Spanish to provide the basics for voters with disabilities.  ADRCs, disability organizations, the Living Well project, and others partnered with us to distribute postcards.  Over 50,000 postcards were distributed.
We developed and/or updated ten fact-sheets to support voters with participation in the 2020 elections.  Fact sheets were available on the DVC website to be viewed or printed, and we also mailed copies of materials.  The “Make Your Plan to Vote” fact sheet was shared in food boxes by the Milwaukee Hunger Task Force, and the Milwaukee CIL, Independence First.  The fact sheets included the following:

-Supreme Court Fact Sheet
-Election day Accessibility Checklist
-Supporting Voters as Residential Providers
-DVC Frequently Asked Questions– updated
-Census Fact Sheet
-Make Your Plan to Vote November 3rd  - Milwaukee area
-Make Your Plan to Vote November 3rd  - Statewide
-Absentee Voting Fact Sheet – 2020 Elections
-Guardianship and Voting- Restoring your Right to Vote
-Voting Rights Fact Sheet

To inform voters and service providers during the pandemic, we increased the frequency and reach of the DVC e-newsletter.  During the reporting period, 18 issues were released that addressed COVID related concerns.  The e-newsletter reaches thousands of services providers, community partners, and voters.  In addition to the DVC email list (649), the e-newsletters are shared by the Department of Health Services (DHS) to their listservs (over 11,000 people), the Wisconsin Aging Network, and the Mental Health Task Force / Make It Work Milwaukee listservs (868), BPDD (2500), and by other coalition partners.

During the pandemic, DRW worked to protect the voting rights of residents of care facilities.  Because of the high vulnerability of residents to COVID 19 and restrictions on outsiders entering care facilities, the WEC decided not to move forward with dispatching special voting deputies to conduct in-person absentee voting.  DRW supported this decision, but recommended a menu of alternative options to support voting in care facilities.  DRW worked with WEC to provide input on training and reference materials for facility staff, and also partnered on providing virtual trainings that were promoted to facility staff.  


Work with the Disability Vote Coalition to grow the coalition and increase the number of organizations and individuals around the state working to advance our mission and to engage voters statewide. 

*The Disability Vote Coalition increased our impact and partnerships this year.  Our partnership with the Independent Living Centers great and strengthened with regular participation from each of the CILs, and coalition leadership roles from three CILS.  

*DRW participated in the new Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition (explained earlier in this narrative) which expanded the number of organizations advocating and educating about disability related voting rights and accommodations, and provided new opportunities to engage with diverse communities.  

*Since our ability to directly reach voters was limited by the pandemic, we launched a new initiative, “Voting in the Time of Pandemic” to train more services providers including Aging and Disability Resource Center staff, long term care providers, residential providers including nursing home staff, and mental health providers.  Training and resources were also provided to staff at psychiatric and IDD facilities operated by the state of Wisconsin.  Because voting was now a public health issue, service providers were encouraged to assist their residents and members to vote safely.  During the reporting period, 17 trainings were held to inform providers about how to support members with voting safely.  Thousands of providers participated.  Service providers also accessed the DRW Voter Hotline, and helped to distribute our postcards, fact sheets and posters to voters.


Increase awareness and usage of the Wisconsin Election Commission complaint process and support voters to make complaints.  

In response to recommendations from DRW and other disability advocates, the WEC developed a new online form for votes to report accessibility related concerns.  We used a variety of strategies to promote the options for making a complaint, both informal and formal, and promoted these with regular social media posts, covered in trainings, and in several factsheets (FAQ and Voter Rights).  We also mentioned the options to make a complaint to Hotline callers.  The number of reported complaints to WEC remained low during the reporting period and we will continue our efforts to see that more disabled voters who contact us with a complaint, also report that concern to the WEC so the problem can be addressed.  For example, one blind voter reported her concern that only one headset was available for the accessible voting machine with no provisions for sanitizing.  We helped guide her on how to make a complaint to her municipal clerk, as well as to WEC.  The local clerks took action to address this at all polling places, and the WEC addressed it statewide in guidance to clerks.  .  

*Provide outreach and education regarding voting rights for individuals under guardianship and the process to petition for restoration of voting rights.  With the leadership of Managing Attorney Mitch Hagopian, DRW developed a new fact sheet to explain the process for individuals under guardianship who have lost the right to vote to petition for their right to vote to be restored.  Circuit Court judges review the document and provided feedback.  Two virtual trainings were held to educate people with IDD and their allies about the process to retore voting rights.  

*Provide resources for voters with disabilities to be informed voters.  
DRW/ DVC held a Milwaukee County Executive Candidate Forum January 14th at IndependenceFirst which focused on disability, mental health, and aging issues.  The forum was moderated by DRW’s Barbara Beckert with a panel of community advocates asking questions.   WUMM and Wisconsin Health News covered the forum.
We provided Key Questions for Congressional Candidates, and Key Questions for State Candidates for voters with disabilities members to ask the candidates.  They were promoted on social media, and at virtual trainings. Virtual trainings and social media posts addressed how to be an informed voter.  One of the key resources we promoted is the LWV VOTE411 website.

*Provide resources to educate candidates about the disability vote and priorities for the disability community and engage the grassroots to educate candidates.  
In partnership with Survival Coalition of Wisconsin Disability Organizations, the DVC contributed to a news resource to educate candidates about disability issues: Issues that Impact People with Disabilities in Wisconsin: Background Papers. The document provided background and policy recommendations to candidates on a wide range of issues includes home and community based long term care, Medicaid, employment, education, mental health, supporting children with disabilities, transportation, voting rights, and workforce. The document was disseminated to people with disabilities, family members, advocates and service providers to share with candidates for office.  


Voter Experience Surveys

To gather information from voters with disabilities and their allies about their voting experience to inform our advocacy and training, DRW helped to administer the following surveys:

*Disability Vote coalition Voter Experience survey regarding the April 2020 election.

*Wisconsin Election Protection 2020 Spring Election Report: Report from Non-Partisan Observers of Voting in the April 7, 2020 Presidential Primary and Spring Election.  

*DRW also served on the planning committee for the SABE GoVoter Survey.


Media

DRW increased awareness of voting rights and safe voting through media coverage.  During the reporting period, four press events were held; fifteen press statements were released, and 16 media stories included DRW perspectives regarding voting rights and accessibility.  


Priority 2: Improve the accessibility of Wisconsin elections for voters with disabilities. 
 

Work with coalition partners and policy makers to provide voters with disabilities to equitable access to absentee voting by implementing an ADA compliant screen reader accessible absentee ballot.  

The pandemic elevated Wisconsin’s inequitable access to absentee voting for voters with print disabilities.  With the leadership of our coalition partner Wisconsin Council for the Blind and Visually Impaired, DRW educated the WEC and legislators, voters with disabilities, and our coalition partners about the need to provide equitable access to absentee voting.  

WEC staff moved forward with testing an accessible ballot that could be requested, and provided by e-mail.  However, In June of 2020, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago issued a unanimous decision that banned most voters from having absentee ballots mailed to them.  

DRW continued our work with coalition partners to provide education about the need to change Wisconsin law.  The lack of equitable access to absentee voting was highlighted in our ADA video series, in a virtual event “A Celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Its Impact on Voting Rights” hosted by All Voting Is Local”, and in a virtual training for voters with vision loss.  


Engage in systems advocacy to increase access to Wisconsin DMV locations to improve access to state photo ID for voting for voters with a disability.  This includes expanded hours of operation and locations, as well as lack of ADA accessibility at some locations. 

DMV sites are the only location for non-drivers to obtain access to a photo ID for voting.  A high percentage of Wisconsinites with disabilities are non-drivers, and many experience barriers to obtaining a photo ID for voting.  Limited access to transportation, especially lift equipped transportation, has been an ongoing barrier to obtaining photo ID; the need to isolate during the pandemic further exacerbated transportation barriers.  In addition, DMV offices were closed due to the pandemic and open by appointment only.  To address these barriers, DRW worked with the Dept. of Transportation (DOT) and the Governor’s office to elevate the need to expand access to options to obtain photo ID.  In response to our advocacy, DMV opened a new location in Dane County, re-opened a number of DMV locations, and added some Saturday hours in advance of the fall election.  

DRW was also appointed to serve on a new Non-Driver Advisory Committee established by DOT.  It has provided a forum to elevate concerns about access to DOT for photo ID.  


Improve the accessibility of Wisconsin polling places by providing education and resources on accessibility for Wisconsin clerks and poll workers, through partnering with the Wisconsin Election Commission to develop and enhance training and resources.

DRW continues to serve on the WEC Accessibility Advisory Committee, and to take an active role in providing recommendations to WEC to address accessibility and voter rights, including recommendations on training content for clerks and poll workers  DRW provided COVID related testimony and recommendations to the Wisconsin Election Commission five times to address voting rights, accessibility, and public health concerns during the pandemic.  DRW participated in ongoing consultation to/ and with WEC staff on a weekly basis.

DRW updated our Election day Accessibility Checklist which is a resource for Wisconsin clerks and poll workers.  The Checklist is posted on the WEC website and noted as a resource in communications to Wisconsin clerks and in WEC trainings.  

DRW and other disability advocates were speakers for the WEC webinar for municipal clerks on Polling Place Set-up, which addressed a range of accessibility and accommodation issues.  482 individuals viewed the webinar.

Planned polling place accessibility audits conducted by WEC and DRW were cancelled due to the pandemic.  DRW worked with WEC to develop other strategies to address accessibility.  This included updating the DRW Accessibility Checklist which is posted on the WEC website; provision of free accessibility supplies such as signature guides; van accessible signs; wireless doorbells for curbside voting, and curbside voting signage; updated guidance on Wisconsin’s requirements for curbside voting, a mailing of absentee ballot applications to all registered voters who don’t have a request on file, guidance on the absentee voting process including who can qualify as an indefinitely confined voter; and input on training content for poll workers and clerks.  


Work with Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition and Disability Vote Coalition to monitor voting and address rights violations on election day.  

DRW was a part of Wisconsin Election Protection efforts, as the designated resource to provide technical assistance on disability related issues.  In addition, under the umbrella of the Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition, the LWV of WI organized a state wide network of election day observers.  DRW provided input on the checklist and protocol for observers to include accessibility and voting rights concerns.  We were part of the online group of observers that used an App to report concerns and flag polling place problems and helped with a rapid response strategy.  For example, in the April election, we were able to get guidance from observers at the five Milwaukee polling places to support disabled voters to access curbside voting.  


Other policy achievements to increase access

*WI Act 48.  On November 22, 2019, Governor Evers signed into law Wisconsin Act 48 (AB-168), relating to the requirement for stating name and address prior to voting.  This change in the law allows individuals who cannot state their name and address to have an election official or another individual selected by the voter state the name and address for them.  The need for this change was based on complaints from contacts made to the DRW Voter Hotline regarding voters who experienced discrimination at their polling place related to this requirements.  The bill signing in River Falls was well attended with a sea of blue Disability Vote Coalition Shirts. Past BPDD Board member Ramsey Lee had the honor of introducing Governor Evers.  

*Voters with criminal convictions.  DRW worked with WEC and the Dept. of Corrections (DOC) to improve the communication regarding voting right for individuals who committee a felony and had their voting rights restored.  WEC made changes to MyVote so it no longer shows “felon” as the voter status.  DOC is working with the Division of Community Corrections staff to advance additional language for the discharge certificate, making it very clear not only where they go to register to vote, but also the fact that they are required to re-register. DOC will continue to update that certificate to clarify their rights post-discharge.

*2020 Census.  DRW took an active role in promoting participation of people with disabilities in the census.  DRW’s Barbara Beckert was appointed by Governor Evers to serve on the state’s 2020 Census Complete Count Committee and provided guidance on outreach to people with disabilities.  The DVC “Census Guide for People with Disabilities” was released in February and has been widely distributed.  In partnership with self-advocates, DRW participated in a video on Why the Census Is Important which was shared on the BPDD Self Determination You Tube channel to promote full participation in the Census. PADD, PATBI and PAAT Planning Process

STEP 1: DRW Board conducted virtual listening sessions in conjunction with board meetings during 2020. Notes from those listening sessions were reviewed by the PADD coordinator.

STEP 2: The School & Civil Rights and Community & Institutions teams met virtually in August to review team goals and priorities. Since the teams have multiple funding sources, this process included discussion of, and adoption of, goals and priorities for DRW clients with physical disabilities, mental illness and/or traumatic brain injury in addition to people who have intellectual or developmental disabilities. Discussion of AT issues was woven throughout the meetings. This process involved discussion of data received during the year related to priority areas.  Case experience and trends were considered.  Following the team meetings, the PADD Coordinator reviewed the notes from the meetings and identified which particular goals and priorities were aimed in whole or in part at people with IDD. 

STEP 3: The PADD Coordinator, the PAAT Coordinator, and the PATBI  Coordinator reviewed the notes from the listening sessions and team meetings, examined case data derived from DAD, and considered information received during the calendar year from our service on various administrative agency committees and workgroups, including:  Long Term Care Council (Department of Health Services-DHS),  Children’s Long Term Support Advisory Committee (DHS), IRIS Advisory Committee (DHS) Quarterly Meetings with DHS,  PT/OT and SLP providers (DHS),  Children with Disabilities in the Child Welfare System Standards and Training Workgroup (DCF), Act 185 Programming Workgroup and Girls Committee, Children and Youth Committee of the Mental Health Council (DHS), Office of Children’s Mental Health’s Collective Impact Executive Council (DHS, DCF, DPI, DOC), Coalition for Expanding School Based Mental Health, and Children Come First Advisory Committee (DHS).  The Coordinator then drafted an initial group of PADD Goals and Priorities.

STEP 4:  The PATBI and PAAT plans were completed at this time. 

STEP 5: The initial draft of the PADD plan was then circulated to all employees who are supported by PADD funding or who regularly work with PADD eligible clients with the support of other funding (Public Policy Director, FCIOP program staff, Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) coordinator, and the SSI Managed Care Program Manager). Their comments were considered and, where appropriate, incorporated into the “Draft PADD SGP” which would be made available to the public for comment.

STEP 6: On October 6, 2020 we presented our “Draft PADD SGP” to the University Center for Excellence, Developmental Disabilities consumer advisory committee. Consensus was that the Draft SGP was good and the committee supported it as written. Individual advisory committee members were also encouraged to comment on the document.

STEP 7: Our “Draft PADD SGP” was formally released for a 48-day public comment period on October 13, 2020. It was posted to our website on that date. The document included instructions for how people could provide comments and the deadline to ensure that their comments would be considered (November 30, 2020). In addition, we sent the document to the Board for People with Developmental Disabilities, the membership of the Survival Coalition (statewide coalition of disability organizations), the Independent Living Centers,  The ARC Wisconsin, and Save IRIS. This year we received one comment on our proposed plan. That comment was detailed and supported our propsed goals and priorities.

STEP 8: Presented our Draft PADD SGP to the Board for People with Developmental Disabilities (Wisconsin's CDD) at its November meeting (November 18, 2020). BPDD engaged in a lively dialog regarding our proposed plan and the issues facing people with IDD and endorsed the Draft SGP.

STEP 9: Made final changes to Final Draft of our PADD SGP.

PAVA Priority Setting and Plan Development  

Because of the nature of the work done through PAVA, we have a separate plan development process.

DRW develops and tracks an annual PAVA plan, which is developed with input and collaboration from the Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition and other partners. The PAVA plan and priorities are informed by input from the following coalition partners and resources.

DRW coordinates the Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition (DVC), in partnership with the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities (BPDD). We develop a Coalition plan of work, which is incorporated within the DRW PAVA plan, in addition to DRW specific activities. The coalition meets monthly and has an annual planning meeting. This cross-disability coalition includes voters with disabilities, advocates, and service providers. In addition to DRW and BPDD participating organizations include People First Wisconsin, the 8 Wisconsin independent living centers, Wisconsin Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired, NAMI Wisconsin, Wisconsin Association of the Deaf, League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, and many others.

In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant impact on the 2020 elections, we added an additional goal to assist voters with disabilities in participating in the electoral process.  The goal included the need to address health and safety concerns, as well as the constraints and changing election rules due to COVID-19.

The unique challenges created by COVID 19 required that we be nimble and adapt our plans to include an increased focus on absentee voting, develop new resource and training materials, and train service providers to support their members and residents with voting safely during the pandemic.  We used monthly coalition meetings to recalibrate and update our plan and outreach strategies.  In addition, we participated in a new coalition, Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition which met on weekly basis for much of the year, to address the ongoing COVID related changes and advocate for policy changes.  The Coalition advocates for the rights of voters including but not limited to votes with disabilities, voters from underserved communities, and other marginalized groups. Partners include ACLU of Wisconsin, League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, All Voting Is Local, Wisconsin Conservation Voices, Wisconsin Voices, Souls to the Polls, and Voces De La Frontera.

As input for our planning process, DRW and the DVC used several surveys:
• Results of Disability Vote coalition surveys conducted regarding voter experiences in August 2018 election, November 2018 election, and April 2020 election.
• A May 2020 survey of DVC members to get their concerns and priorities to guide our planning.
• Wisconsin Election Protection 2020 Spring Election Report: Report from Non-Partisan Observers of Voting in the April 7, 2020 Presidential Primary and Spring Election

Calls to the DRW Voter Hotline are an important input for our PAVA plan.  We log and track calls and identify concerns barriers reported by callers to guide priorities for the plan.  Call volume was especially high this year because of the pandemic; barriers identified by callers were vitally important to informing changes in our plan and in our outreach and training methods.  In addition, we received input from community members through social media, including the Disability Vote Coalition and DRW Facebook pages.

DRW participates in the Wisconsin Election Commission Accessibility Advisory Committee which has quarterly meetings. Issues and barriers identified by this Committee were used to develop the PAVA priorities and plan.

DRW also receives input for the PAVA plan from other coalitions and committees regarding voter experiences and barriers, and these are used to inform our PAVA plan. These include the Survival Coalition of Wisconsin Disability Organizations, Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources (GWAAR), Milwaukee Mental Health Task Force, Wisconsin Council on Mental Health, Shelter and Transitional Housing Task Force, and Aging & Disability Professionals of Wisconsin (ADPAW). Input is also provided from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services including from staff that oversee state psychiatric hospitals, long term care facilities, and other residential providers.

We collaborate on our voting advocacy with organizations representing diverse communities and their perspectives inform our plan.  These organizations include the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin, Alianza Latina Aplicando Soluciones, Souls to the Polls, Wisconsin United Coalition of Mutual Assistance Associations (WUCMAA), and Voces de la Frontera.

DRW P & A staff had the opportunity to provide input to the PAVA plan at the annual planning meeting in August. DRW specific goals were included in the plan, including our role in conducting polling place accessibility audits, providing direct advocacy assistance to voters with disabilities, and staffing the DRW Voter Hotline.  Planned accessibility audits were not able to move forward due to COVID 19 restrictions.",,,,,

Priority 1: Prevent discrimination against people with IDD and other disabilities in rationing and other policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic. (PADD, PAAT, PATBI, PAVA)

State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee-Subcommittee on Vaccine Distribution: DRW represented the interests of people with IDD (and other disabilities) on this subcommittee which determined the order of priority for initial distribution of COVID-19 vaccine.  The subcommittee met in open meeting via Zoom twice a week from October 2020 through Mid-January of 2021.  In between meetings we reviewed data, available CDC and ACIP guidance, and proposals for vaccine distribution in other states.   Our proposals for distribution were subject to public comment and the issue generated more than 5000 public comments.  The DRW representative personally reviewed the 600-plus comments that related to which phase of distribution would include people with health conditions that placed them at greater risk for bad outcomes from COVID. This group was essentially the client group we were representing on the subcommittee. We were able to convince the subcommittee to prioritize one subgroup of this population-people who were enrolled in the state’s HCBS programs. This resulted in some 30,000+ people with IDD and 40,000+ people with physical disabilities (including TBI) getting access to vaccine months before the general public.  

Case 1: Represented state DD Center resident with multiple severe developmental disabilities (including hypothermia) who was nonverbal, nonambulatory, and in need of total care in an informal request for an accommodation from a Hospital policy prohibiting visitors during COVID 19.  Client was hospitalized for COVID-19, and was in need of a round-the-clock supporter while in the hospital  because of a complete inability to communicate needs, level of pain, or discomfort, in ways that could be recognized by unfamiliar caregivers.  Accommodation request was made under the ADA and Rehab Act in anticipation of possible litigation if it was denied. Hospital granted request and allowed client's mom/guardian to act as a supporter for her child while they were an inpatient at the hospital. The client's inability to communicate or use the call system due to disability were the major factors in the Hospital's decision to grant relief from the policy.

Case 2: Represented woman with mild IDD who was adamant that she wanted to be vaccinated against COVID against her guardians.  She and her mother (with whom she lived) had both had COVID and she did not want to get it again. Co-guardians (ward’s siblings) were reluctant, and one was anti-vaccine. Spoke with and communicated in writing to guardians on their duty to seek appropriate preventative care for their ward regardless of their personal beliefs on COVID vaccination. Noted that failure to secure vaccine could be construed as medical neglect of ward and failure to implement the clear and rational preference of ward was contrary to ward’s best interest and grounds for removal.  Guardians agreed to arrange for ward to be vaccinated and she was vaccinated. 


Priority 2: Ensure students with disabilities are provided with a Free Appropriate Public Education during school closures and in the virtual learning environment (PADD, PAAT, PATBI)

COVID Fact Sheets: Created Facts Sheets with Frequently Asked Questions on 2 subjects: Masks in Schools, and Children with Disabilities in Schools During COVID-19. Collected FAQ's from advocates were receiving from clients; researched to answer them; and make recommendations. Sent fact sheets to parents who called DRW with questions about their child's special education rights during pandemic. Also posted them to our website. 

Case Examples:

DRW assisted numerous families who struggled with pandemic protocols in getting special education for their children.  These ranged from students who, due to their disabilities, were unable to wear masks in classrooms where they were required to students who were especially vulnerable who needed others to wear masks where they were not required.  We helped students who were repeatedly sent home due to COVID protocol violations as an excuse to not have to address the students’ behavior issues.  
We also helped students who were learning virtually but who had poor internet access and were being marked truant. We helped students get virtual education who were unable to attend in person due to their disabilities and we helped students obtain in person services when they could not benefit from virtual education.  As indicated above, we developed a fact sheet for parents that included questions and answers as well as links to numerous resources.

Case Example: DRW represented a boy with significant developmental delays who could not benefit from virtual education. His school district offered only virtual services.  We filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) (the State Education Agency).  The DPI found that the district was not providing a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE).  We represented the family in a mediation and negotiated a resolution as to how he would be compensated for his loss of services.


Priority 3: Ensure people with disabilities' access to the right to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic. (PADD, PATBI, PAAT)
During the reporting period, the following statewide elections were held:

• The November 2020 Presidential election
• Spring Primary: February 16, 2021
• Spring Election: April 6, 2021 

Throughout the reporting period, the voting rights and access for Wisconsinites with disabilities continued to be impacted by the pandemic, due to the heightened vulnerability to COVID of many people with disabilities, especially those living in congregate settings. 

Concern about COVID 19 led to an increase in absentee voting, as many were reluctant or unable to vote at their polling place.  Social distancing also reduced opportunities for DRW to provide in person assistance with voter registration, photo ID requirements, and education about voter rights and resources.  DRW recalibrated our PAVA work, to include additional outreach and training strategies to protect the rights of people with disabilities during the pandemic, as noted below.  

This work was done in partnership with:

• The Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition (DVC), a cross disability coalition that includes disability and aging agencies, and self advocates, coordinated by DRW and the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities. Key partners include the eight Independent Living Centers, WI Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired, Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging, People First Wisconsin, Souls to the Polls, ALAS, NAMI Wisconsin and affiliates, the League of Women Voters WI, and All Voting Is Local.  The Coalition also had strong partnerships with provider agencies.

• Wisconsin Department of Health Services.  DHS provided public health guidance during the pandemic and state government, included guidance on safe voting practices.  They partner with us on dissemination of our trainings, videos, and fact sheets. We also partnered with the Wisconsin Departments of Transportation and Corrections.

• Wisconsin Election Commission, the state government body that administers Wisconsin elections.

• City of Milwaukee Election Commission, and other municipal clerks

• Service providers for people with disabilities including those in residential settings.

• Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition.  A coalition of voting rights, civil rights, and advocacy agencies that emerged in response to the challenges of voting during the pandemic.  The coalition included non-profits around the state who shared a commitment to voting rights, including several agencies that had a focus on supporting communities of color.

We identified the following priorities related to COVID-19:

• Ensure people with disabilities access to the right to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic and advocate for safe voting policies.

• Provide training and support materials for service providers, including direct care providers and care facilities, to support their members to safely assert their voting rights during the pandemic, and in the absence of Special Voting Deputies at residential facilities. 

• In collaboration with the Wisconsin Election Commission (WEC), provide clerks and other local election workers with the training and supplies needed to safely conduct elections during the pandemic.  

Activities to support these priorities included the following:

• Provided COVID related testimony and recommendations to the Wisconsin Election Commission four times to address voting rights, accessibility, disability related accommodations, and public health concerns during the pandemic.  DRW provided ongoing consultation to/ and with WEC staff on a regular basis.  

Voting in care facilities continued to be an area of particular concern given the high vulnerability of residents to COVID 19 and restrictions on outsiders entering care facilities.  DRW worked with WEC to provide input on WEC training and reference materials to facility staff, and also partnered on providing virtual trainings that were offered to facility staff.  Training videos were also available on the Disability Vote Coalition web site.

Planned polling place accessibility audits to be conducted by WEC and DRW were cancelled due to the pandemic.  DRW worked with WEC to develop other strategies to address accessibility.  This included updating the DRW Accessibility Checklist which is posted on the WEC website and distributed to clerks; provision of free accessibility supplies such as signature guides, van accessible parking signs, wireless doorbells for curbside voting, and curbside voting signage; guidance on Wisconsin’s requirements for curbside voting; info about absentee voting and drop boxes; and input on training content for poll workers and clerks.  DRW and other disability advocates were speakers for the WEC webinar for municipal clerks on Polling Place Set-up, which addressed a range of accessibility and accommodation issues.  While the webinar took place on September 30, 2020, a video recording was posted on the WEC website, and many clerks and election workers accessed it in October in advance of the November election.  In addition to the live webinar, there have been 937 views of the video.  

• DRW also addressed accessibility concerns by partnering with the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin Election Observation Program.  We provided input on accessibility concerns to be included in the survey tool used by election observers, including criteria related to polling place accessibility, status of accessible voting machines, and curbside voting.  We provided technical assistance to observers who identified concerns on election day and helped to elevate issues to the Wisconsin Election Commission as needed.  

• DRW served on the Wisconsin Safe and Healthy Voting Project Committee to provide a disability perspective in support of efforts to ensure safe voting practices during COVID including providing PPE for workers, training on safe practices, and provision of curbside voting and absentee drop boxes.

• In advance of the November election and on election day, the DRW Voter Hotline continued to receive calls for assistance from voters with disabilities, family members and providers who were concerned about voting safely during COVID.  A high percentage of contacts requested assistance with absentee voting.  

We assisted voters with disabilities who had COVID specific concerns.  This included assistance with how to access curb-side voting; assisting voters to file complaints regarding concerns about poll workers who would not wear masks; and assisting voters who were home bound or in hospital due to COVID with requesting an absentee ballot and providing volunteers to deliver the ballot, and have it witnessed and returned.   We also assisted a voter with a disability and her husband who lived in a township that was holding in person caucus to determine candidates for the spring election and did not require masks.  The voter was ultimately denied a virtual option, although other accommodations were offered.

The Milwaukee Election Commission had included DRW Voter Hotline information on several mailings to the community, which contributed to a higher call volume from Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s most diverse community.  

• Developed and/or updated 11 voting fact sheets to support voters with participation in the 2021 elections. Ten of the fact sheets are available in Spanish.  A number of the fact sheets included information about safe voting during the pandemic, and the frequent COVID related changes in voting.  We also continued to promote our video trainings on voting developed earlier in 2020, which addressed safe voting during the pandemic.  Materials were available on the Disability Vote Coalition website, Facebook page, and mailed at no charge to community members and agencies, as requested.  We used new methods to distribute materials – for example, our “Make Your Plan to Vote” factsheet was included in food boxes distributed by the Hunger Task Force and by an independent living center in October 2020.

• Provided regular posting on the Disability Vote Coalition and DRW Facebook pages that promoted safe voting during the pandemic, including information about absentee voting, drop boxes, curbside voting, and tips for voting safely in person.  

• Since in-person trainings and outreach events could not be offered during the pandemic, we continued to offer virtual training events, and also developed a series of videos about how to vote safely. DRW conducted outreach and training events during the 2021 FY, reaching approximately 2194 people.  Prior to the November election, we offered a Lunch and Learn series that included guidance on how to vote safely during the pandemic.  A candidate forum for Dept. of Public Instruction Superintendent was held virtually in advance of the April 2021, to allow for safe participation by voters with disabilities.  

• Since our ability to directly reach voters was limited by the pandemic, we continued our “Voting in the Time of Pandemic” initiative to reach services providers including Aging and Disability Resource Center staff, long term care providers, residential providers including nursing home staff, and staff at psychiatric and IDD facilities operated by the state of Wisconsin.  Because voting was a public health issue, service providers were encouraged to assist their residents and members to vote safely.  Providers received our e-newsletters, technical assistance from the DRW Voter Hotline, and could order or download our free resource materials.  

• To inform voters and service providers during the pandemic, we increased the frequency and reach of the DVC e-newsletter.  During the reporting period, 21 issues were released that provided voting updates, including how to vote safely during the pandemic.  The e-newsletter reaches thousands of services providers, community partners, and voters.  In addition to the DVC email list (649), the e-newsletters are shared with the Department of Health Services (DHS) listservs (over 11,000 people), the Wisconsin Aging Network, and the Mental Health Task Force / Make It Work Milwaukee listservs (868), BPDD (2500), and shared by other coalition partners.

• COVID-19 increased barriers for people with disabilities to obtain a photo ID for voting at Wisconsin Department of Motor V locations.  During much of 2020, DMV offices were closed due to the pandemic and open by appointment only.  Limited access to transportation, especially lift equipped transportation, has been an ongoing barrier to obtaining photo ID; the need to isolate during the pandemic further exacerbated transportation barriers.  DRW worked with the Dept. of Transportation and the Governor’s office to elevate the need to expand access to options to obtain photo ID. In response to our advocacy, DMV expanded DMV hours in at a number of rural locations, in Milwaukee and in Madison.  An additional Madison location was opened that on a bus line and provided better access for people of color and many people with disabilities.  

• DRW increased awareness of voting rights and safe voting through media coverage during the pandemic.  Two press events were held; nine press statements were released that related to voting and the pandemic, and 24 media stories included DRW perspectives regarding COVID 10 and voting. During the reporting period, the following statewide elections were held:
• The November 2020 Presidential election
• Spring Primary: February 16, 2021
• Spring Election: April 6, 2021 

Throughout the reporting period, DRW’s PAVA work was impacted by the following challenges:

• Voting rights and access for Wisconsinites with disabilities continued to be impacted by the pandemic, due to high vulnerability to COVID of many people with disabilities, especially those living in congregate settings. Concern about COVID 19 led to an increase in absentee voting, as many citizens were reluctant or unable to vote at their polling place.
 
• Social distancing created additional barriers by eliminating most opportunities for DRW to provide in person assistance with voter registration, photo ID requirements, and education about voter rights and resources, or conduct polling place audits.  Finally, the process for voting, especially absentee voting, changed repeatedly as a result of litigation and evolving guidance.
 
• Following the 2020 election, and unproven allegations of voter fraud, the state legislature considered a number of proposals that had the potential to restrict the voting rights of many disabled voters, and create new barriers.  

This narrative will detail how DRW recalibrated our PAVA work, to support voters with disabilities during the pandemic, and to protect their voting rights.  This work was done in partnership with:

• The Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition (DVC), a cross disability coalition that includes disability and aging agencies and self advocates, coordinated by DRW and the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities (BPDD). Key coalition members include the eight Independent Living Centers, WI Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired, Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources (GWAAR), People First Wisconsin, ALAS, NAMI Wisconsin and affiliates, the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, Souls to the Polls, and All Voting Is Local.  The Coalition also had strong partnerships with provider agencies.

•Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS).  DHS provided public health guidance during the pandemic, included guidance on safe voting practices.  They partnered with us on dissemination of our trainings, videos, and fact sheets. We also partnered with the Wisconsin Departments of Transportation and Corrections.

• Wisconsin Election Commission (WEC), the state government body that administers Wisconsin elections, including DRW’s service on the WEC Accessibility Advisory Committee.

• City of Milwaukee Election Commission, and other municipal clerks

• Service providers for people with disabilities including residential service providers.

• Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition.  A coalition of voting rights, civil rights, and advocacy agencies that emerged in response to the challenges of voting during the pandemic.  The coalition included non-profits around the state who share a commitment to voting rights, including several agencies that focus on advancing voting rights for communities of color, and election protection partners. See Coalition partners for a full list.


Priority # 1: Assist voters with disabilities to learn about how to register to vote, cast a ballot, access polling places, and assert their voting rights. 


1) Provide direct assistance and education to voters with disabilities regarding voter registration, absentee voting, casting a ballot at their polling place, and voter rights.  

DRW Voter Hotline.  The DRW Voter Hotline is open year-round.  Call volume during the reporting period was highest for the November 2020 election, with lower call volume for the 2021 elections.  

A high percentage of calls were about Absentee and Early Voting.  Absentee voting related calls addressed confusion about how to request an absentee ballot, struggles with the process for uploading photo ID or lack of photo ID, challenges with the witness requirement, and ballots that were late arriving.  We also heard from callers with vision loss who were experiencing challenges with voting due to the lack of an accessible absentee ballot.

For those voting in person, topics included the need for, or denial of accommodations such as curbside voting or assistance with completing a ballot; changes in polling places, long lines, communication challenges, transportation.

We also received questions about guardianship and voting rights. 

A number of callers had COVID related concerns.  We provided assistance with how to access curb-side voting; assisting voters to file complaints regarding concerns about poll workers who would not wear masks; and assisting voters who were home bound or in hospital due to COVID with requesting an absentee ballot and providing volunteers to deliver ballots, and have them witnessed and returned. 

We also assisted a voter with a disability and her husband who lived in a township that was holding in person caucus to determine candidates for the spring election and did not require masks.  The voter was ultimately denied a virtual option, although other accommodations were offered.

Transportation was an issue for a number of callers, and we were often able to provide a referral.  We offered a new resource on the DVC website “Find a Ride to the Polls” with transportation contacts around the state.  This was developed with the support of many partners including Aging and Disability Resource Centers, counties, transportation providers, the Arc Wisconsin, Souls to the Polls, and others.  “Find a Ride to the Polls” was available for the November 2020 election (including early voting) and for the April 2021 election.  In one case an African American voter with mobility issues had cast a provisional ballot.  She needed transportation and an assistant to accompany her to DMV to obtain a photo ID, and to city hall to cure her ballot.  We worked with Souls to the Polls to connect her with a volunteer to provide transportation and support – this was the last caller we assisted to cast a ballot for the November 2020 election.  

In addition to voters with disabilities, we provided assistance to providers seeking guidance and resources on how to help their members/ residents to vote.  DRW received referrals from other voter hotlines, and we worked together with our coalition partners, as well as WEC and local clerks to meet voter needs.  In addition, we received referrals from Wisconsin Election Protection and from the network of on site observers coordinated by LWVW.  

DRW partnered with the City of Milwaukee to support voters with disabilities. The Milwaukee Election Commission included the DRW Voter Hotline number on postcards that they sent in advance of the election. This resulted in many calls to the voter hotline from voters needing help with absentee ballots, finding their polling places, and questions about curbside voting and photo IDs. This was helpful in expanding our reach to minority voters, as Milwaukee is Wisconsin’s most diverse municipality.

Outreach and Training.  DRW conducted outreach and training events during the 2021 FY, reaching approximately 2,194 people, using the Zoom and Facebook live platforms.  Prior to the November election, we offered a Lunch and Learn series with topics: Registration and Photo ID, Voting Rights, Taking the SABE Survey, Absentee and Early Voting.  Training were also held on the proposed state budget, and legislative proposals that would impact voting rights.  Participants were trained on self advocacy tools to share their perspective with policy makers on budget proposals and legislation.  

Residential Providers.  During the pandemic, DRW worked to protect the voting rights of residents of care facilities.  Because of the high vulnerability of residents to COVID 19 and restrictions on outsiders entering care facilities, the WEC did not dispatch Special Voting Deputies to conduct in-person absentee voting.  DRW supported this decision, but recommended a menu of alternative options to support voting in care facilities.  DRW worked with WEC to provide input on training and reference materials for facility staff, and also partnered on providing virtual trainings that were promoted to facility staff.  

People with IDD.  DRW and the DVC provided regulates outreach and training on voting rights, guardianship and voting, and making a plan to vote to people with Intellectual and Developmental disabilities through updates to People First Wisconsin, as well as monthly trainings for Living Well participants, a project of the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities.  Utilizing monthly or periodic virtual meetings to update self-advocates has empowered them to share this information with the people in their communities, including local People First chapters. 

Social media.  DRW maintained the fully accessible Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition website (https://disabilityvote.org/), with continuously updated content.  All coalition fact sheets and videos are posted on the website, as is the DVC e-newsletter, policy updates, and current news.  DRW continued to have a strong robust social media presence with our Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition and DRW Facebook pages, and twitter posts. A monthly social calendar is developed with scheduled posts; the calendar is also made available to Coalition members so their agencies can select posts to use on their social media.  Topics include information about voter registration, getting a photo ID, requesting and voting with an absentee ballot, finding your polling place, transportation to the polls, and voting rights and accommodations. The most popular posts include our voter spotlights and featured partners, which highlight a voter with a disability or a coalition partner, explaining why voting is important to them.  Social media has also been a vehicle for sharing policy updates and opportunities for people with disabilities to share their perspective with their legislators.  Our most liked post had video footage of a coalition member with a disability sharing her perspective on how proposed legislation would impact her voting rights.  

Our postcard campaign continued with free postcards available in English and Spanish to provide the basics for voters with disabilities about the 2021 elections, as well as our posters featuring voters with disabilities.  ADRCs, disability organizations, the Living Well project, and others partnered with us to distribute postcards. 4,900 postcards were mailed, and an additional 15,000 were provided to coalition members to distribute, or shared at community events.  

Developed and/or updated eleven voting fact sheets to support voters with participation in the 2020 - 2021 elections. Ten of the fact sheets are available in Spanish.  A number of the fact sheets included information about safe voting during the pandemic, and the frequent COVID related changes in voting.  We also continued to promote our video trainings on voting developed earlier in 2020, which addressed safe voting during the pandemic.  Materials were available on the Disability Vote Coalition website, Facebook page, and mailed at no charge to community members and agencies, as requested.  This included our voter toolkit which provides materials to offer a training on voting for people with disabilities.  We offered the option to download the toolkit or to order a kit to be printed and mailed.  We used new methods to distribute materials – for example, our “Make Your Plan to Vote” factsheet was included in food boxes distributed by the Hunger Task Force and by an independent living center in October 2020.

The fact sheets included the following:
• Circuit Court Fact Sheet
• Circuit Court Fact Sheet (Spanish)
• State Superintendent of Public Instruction Fact Sheet
• State Superintendent of Public Instruction Fact Sheet (Spanish)
• Residential Service Providers: Resources for Voters with Disabilities (updated)
• Election day Accessibility Checklist
• Make Your Plan to Vote AD 37 Special Election
• Make Your Plan to Vote – 2021 Elections (updated)
• Absentee Voting Fact Sheet (updated)
• Absentee Voting Fact Sheet -Spanish
• Guardianship and Voting- Restoring your Right to Vote
• Voting Rights Fact Sheet
• Voting Rights Fact Sheet (Spanish)
• Voting Registration Fact Sheet
• Guardianship and Voting: Restoring Your Right to Vote
• Voting In Wisconsin (Spanish)
• Voting In Wisconsin (updated)

E-Newsletter.  During the reporting period, 21 issues of the DVC e-newsletter were released that provided voting updates and resources.  The e-newsletter reaches thousands of services providers, community partners, and voters.  In addition to the DVC email list (649), the e-newsletters are shared by the Department of Health Services (DHS) to their listservs (over 11,000 people), the Wisconsin Aging Network, and the Mental Health Task Force / Make It Work Milwaukee listservs (868), BPDD (2500), and by other coalition partners.


2) Work with the Disability Vote Coalition to grow the coalition and increase the number of organizations and individuals around the state working to advance our mission and to engage voters statewide.

The Disability Vote Coalition increased our impact and partnerships this year.  Our partnership with the Independent Living Centers expanded, with active participation in the coalition from four CILs; all eight CILs promoted and disseminated our voting resources and trainings.  Other new partners included the Wisconsin MS Society, and the My Choice Family Care member advisory committee.

• DRW played a lead role in the Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition (explained earlier in this narrative), sharing analysis regarding the impact of legislative proposals on voters with disabilities, and providing technical assistance to coalition members on disability related rights and accommodations. This partnership has expanded the number of organizations advocating and educating about disability related voting rights and accommodations, and provided new opportunities to engage with diverse communities. 

• Reaching diverse communities.  Our partnership with Souls to the Polls allowed us to reach more voters of color.  DRW provided technical assistance on disability related voting concerns, and Souls helped to provide transportation for some voters with disabilities and assisted with curbside voting. Outreach to Spanish speaking voters was done in partnership with ALAS (Alianza Latina Aplicando Soluciones) and Voces de la Frontera.  

• Increase awareness and usage of the Wisconsin Election Commission complaint process and support voters to make complaints.

We used a variety of strategies to promote options for making a complaint, both informal and formal: social media posts, addressing in trainings, and in several factsheets (FAQ and Voter Rights).  We also mentioned the options to make a complaint to Hotline callers.  The number of reported complaints to WEC remained low during the reporting period and we will continue our efforts to see that more disabled voters who contact us with a complaint, also report that concern to the WEC.  We are often able to help a caller resolve a concern and they may be hesitant or lack interest in pursuing a formal complaint.  

For example, one voter contacted DRW because she had been unable to vote in 2021. The voter had called her municipal clerk early in the year. The clerk assured the voter that she was signed up as an indefinitely confined voter; however, the voter’s ballot never arrived. She called the municipal clerk again, but it was too late to get her ballot. DRW staff were able to help the voter sign up as an indefinitely confined voter for future elections and, also, to file an online complaint with WEC. The voter lives in a small town and is very afraid of retaliation over filing the complaint. She expressed that without the support of the DRW voter hotline, she wouldn’t feel comfortable making the complaint.

National Disability Voter Registration Week NDVRW is a national, nonpartisan campaign to register, educate, and prepare voters with disabilities to vote in upcoming elections.  Our in-person outreach efforts were limited by continued health concerns due to COVID-19.  To promote voter registration, the DVC hosted two virtual events, and offered an online toolkit, including the following:

• Voter Registration Resources Toolkit on the DVC website
• Webinar on voter registration for voters with disabilities and allies
• Webinar for service providers on how to support their members with voter registration and photo ID 
• Proclamation and video from Governor Evers and a press release from Senator Kathy Bernier, chair of the Senate Elections committee
• Social media toolkit with NDVRW graphics and Facebook / Zoom background.  

3) Provide outreach and education regarding voting rights for individuals under guardianship and the process to petition for restoration of voting rights.  

DRW expanded our work in this area, hiring a part-time attorney to serve as our Voting Rights and Guardianship Project Director.  The project is underway and includes development of a training and outreach plan to include the legal and social services communities, families, and people with disabilities.  We will also develop a plan to provide pro bono representation for individuals seeking to have their rights restored.  The project is advancing in collaboration with the Guardianship Support Center, BPDD and other partners.

During the reporting period, DRW and the DVC continued to provide education on guardianship and voting rights through virtual trainings, social media, and dissemination of our fact sheets.  DRW Managing Attorney Mitch Hagopian assisted two individuals under guardianship who have lost the right to vote to petition for their right to vote to be restored.  

4) Provide resources for voters with disabilities to be informed voters.  

On March 4th. DRW and the DVC hosted a State Superintendent of Public Instruction candidate forum.  The forum was an opportunity to hear from candidates.  Deborah Kerr and Jill Underly about how they would address the needs of students with disabilities.  179 registered for this event, and the recording was made available on our website and you-tube channel.  We received 58 questions for the candidates from community members.  The forum had live captioning and ASL interpreters.  It was live-streamed by WisconsinEye.  

We promoted our “Key Questions for Congressional Candidates, and Key Questions for State Candidates” for voters with disabilities to ask the candidates.  They were shared on social media, and at virtual trainings.  

Virtual trainings and social media posts addressed how to be an informed voter, including use of nonpartisan resources such as the LWV VOTE411 website.

5) Provide resources to educate candidates about the disability vote and priorities for the disability community and engage the grassroots to educate candidates.

In partnership with Survival Coalition of Wisconsin Disability Organizations, DRW and the DVC promoted our publication to educate candidates about disability issues: Issues that Impact People with Disabilities in Wisconsin: Background Papers. The document provided background and policy recommendations to candidates on a wide range of issues includes home and community based long term care, Medicaid, employment, education, mental health, supporting children with disabilities, transportation, voting rights, and workforce. The document was disseminated to people with disabilities, family members, advocates and service providers to share with candidates for office, and also promoted to state legislators.  
 

Priority 2: Improve the accessibility of Wisconsin elections for voters with disabilities.  

Voter Experience Surveys.  To gather information from voters with disabilities and their allies about their voting experience to inform our advocacy and training, DRW served on the planning committee for the SABE GoVoter Survey and promoted the SABE survey in Wisconsin. In cooperation with The Self-Determination, DRW developed a promotional video to encourage self-advocates to take the SABE survey and how to get help if they need it.  Wisconsin collected 86 responses this year, 4th highest in the country.  It was more challenging to obtain survey responses this year, since we could not provide in person outreach and assistance due to COVID.  DRW also partnered with SABE to present on the survey project at the NDRN conference.  

Media.  DRW increased awareness of voting rights and accessibility through media coverage.  During the reporting period, DRW participated in five press events; eighteen press statements were released, and 59 media stories included DRW/ DVC perspectives regarding voting rights and accessibility, including 26 radio or tv interviews.    

1) Engage with legislators to educate and advocate about the voting rights of people with disabilities and increase awareness of barriers.  Respond to legislative proposals and advance our policy agenda.

Following the November 2020 presidential election, Wisconsin has been torn apart by attacks on election administration and allegations of fraud.  The voting rights of people with disabilities have been a central part of the controversy as some have made allegations of fraud on the voters with disabilities including some who self-certified as indefinitely confined voters, residents of care facilities whose right to vote and cognitive status was challenged, and individuals who relied on assistance from others to complete and./or return their absentee ballot.  Over two dozen proposals were circulated in our state legislature to make changes to voting rights, including a number of proposals which would create new barriers for many voters with disabilities, and establish penalties for voters or people trying to help voters.  

DRW used the following strategies to educate policymakers and to inform people with disabilities to support them to advocate.  Many of these efforts were in partnership with the Disability Vote Coalition and other:

• Meet with state legislators to provide education about the rights of voters with disabilities and increase awareness of barriers.  

• DRW provided testimony eleven times for legislative hearings to educate policy makers about the impact of proposed legislation on voters with disabilities and barriers experienced by voters with disabilities.

• DRW was the only disability group and one of only three voting rights groups to be interviewed by the Wisconsin Legislative Audit Bureau for their audit reviewing election administration for the November 2020 election.

• Our April 12th Briefing, “Disability Rights and Voting: A Briefing for Policymakers and Election Officials” was attended by 70 people including a number of state legislators and staff.  The Briefing addressed the barriers experienced by many voters with disabilities and provided an overview of federal and state laws that safeguard the rights of voters with disabilities.  28 community agencies co-sponsored the briefing.

• Surveyed people with disabilities, older adults and family members to see how the voting bills would impact their ability to vote.  We received 341 responses.

• Social media campaigns including ADA 31 Social Media toolkit with the theme “Honor the ADA – Protect Voter Rights”.  

• Two press events were held for the media to hear from people with disabilities and allies about the impact of the voting bills. 

• Information about the bills, and training on how people with disabilities could express their option was provided to disability groups.  Four virtual trainings were held. Self advocates, family members, and other allies utilized DRW/ DVC training and resource materials to provide testimony at legislative hearings, submit letters to the editor, and speak at press events.   

• DRW spoke at a White House convening about the impact of the bills and the strategies used by DVC and DRW to respond.  She also shared concerns about the paper ballot mandate in HR 1, and the need to protect the rights of voters who cannot mark, verify, and cast paper ballots privately and independently.


2) Engage in systems advocacy to increase access to Wisconsin DMV locations to improve access to state photo ID for voting for voters with a disability.  This includes expanded hours of operation and locations, as well as lack of ADA accessibility at some locations. 

DMV sites are the only location for non-drivers to obtain access to a photo ID for voting.  A high percentage of Wisconsinites with disabilities are non-drivers, and many experience barriers to obtaining a photo ID for voting.  Limited access to transportation, especially lift equipped transportation, has been an ongoing barrier to obtaining photo ID; the need to isolate during the pandemic further exacerbated transportation barriers.  

Report on DMV and Voting Rights.  DRW and the DVC partnered with All Voting Is Local and the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin on a report about photo ID and access to DMV.  “Getting There is Half the Battle: Wisconsin’s Photo ID Law, Access to DMV Services, and the Fight for Our Freedom to Vote.”  The report was released on May 26th and highlighted inequities in access to DMV services, and the implications for voting rights.  The report included comprehensive recommendations to address barriers and expand access including addressing ADA accessibility concerns and providing language support for non-English speakers.  DRW was among the panelists who presented report findings at a May 26th press event and a June 2nd community briefing.  We are working with the DVC on a DMV checklist for physical and programmatic accessibility to be shared with DMV in early 2022.  The report was also shared with state legislators.  

In addition to existing barriers to accessing DMV, COVID-19 increased barriers for people with disabilities to obtain a photo ID.  During much of 2020, DMV offices were closed due to the pandemic and open by appointment only.  Limited access to transportation, especially lift equipped transportation, has been an ongoing barrier to obtaining photo ID; the need to isolate during the pandemic further exacerbated transportation barriers.  DRW worked with the Dept. of Transportation and the Governor’s office to elevate the need to expand access to options to obtain photo ID. In response to our advocacy, DMV expanded DMV hours in at a number of rural locations, in Milwaukee and in Madison.  An additional Madison location was opened that on a bus line and provided better access for people of color and many people with disabilities.  DOT also included some funding in the proposed state budget for additional DMV locations, however, it was not approved by the State Legislature.

DRW continues to serve on the Non-Driver Advisory Committee recently established by DOT.  It has provided a forum to elevate concerns about access accessible transportation, limited access to DMV for photo ID, as well as DMV accessibility concerns.  


3) Improve the accessibility of Wisconsin polling places by providing education and resources on accessibility for Wisconsin clerks and poll workers, through partnering with the Wisconsin Election Commission to develop and enhance training and resources.

DRW provided testimony to the Wisconsin Election Commission six times during the reporting period to address voting rights, accessibility, disability related accommodations, use of Special Voting Deputies, certification of voting equipment, and COVID related public health concerns during the reporting period.  DRW provided ongoing consultation to/ and with WEC staff on a regular basis.  
DRW continues to serve on the WEC Accessibility Advisory Committee which met four times during the reporting period and provided recommendations to the WEC on accessibility concerns.  DRW and other committee members participated in testing of accessible voting equipment sessions hosted by the WEC to assess accessibility.  DRW provided public comments supporting de-certification of accessible voting equipment that did not meet accessibility standards.  

Planned polling place accessibility audits to be conducted by WEC and DRW were cancelled due to the pandemic.  DRW worked with WEC to develop other strategies to address accessibility.  This included:

• Promoting the DRW Election Day Accessibility Checklist which is posted on the WEC website and distributed to clerks and election inspectors; 

• The WEC Accessibility Supply Program, which provided free supplies such as signature guides, van accessible parking signs, wireless doorbells for curbside voting, and curbside voting signage

• Provide input for WEC guidance on Wisconsin’s requirements for curbside voting, and assisting voters who experienced barriers to accessing curbside voting.  

• Provide recommendations for absentee voting and drop boxes

• DRW and other disability advocates were speakers for the WEC webinar for municipal clerks on Polling Place Set-up, which addressed a range of accessibility and accommodation issues.  While the webinar took place on September 30, 2020, a video recording was posted on the WEC website, and many clerks and election workers accessed it in October in advance of the November election.  In addition to the live webinar, there have been 937 views of the video.  

• Work with Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition and Disability Vote Coalition to monitor voting and address rights violations on election day.

DRW was a part of Wisconsin Election Protection efforts, as the designated resource to provide technical assistance on disability related issues.  In addition, under the umbrella of the Wisconsin Voting Rights Coalition, the LWV of WI organized a state wide network of election day observers.  DRW provided input on the checklist and protocol for observers to assess accessibility and voting rights concerns.  We were part of the online group of observers that used an App to report concerns and flag polling place problems and helped with a rapid response strategy.  For example, we helped to elevate accessible voting machine concerns and poor curb side voting practices to the WEC so they could follow up directly with clerks allowing problems to be addressed in real time.  

• Work with coalition partners and policy makers to provide voters with disabilities to equitable access to absentee voting by implementing an ADA compliant screen reader accessible absentee ballot.  

The pandemic elevated Wisconsin’s inequitable access to absentee voting for voters with print disabilities.  With the leadership of our coalition partner Wisconsin Council for the Blind and Visually Impaired, DRW continued to educate and advocate for an accessible absentee ballot with the WEC, legislators, voters with disabilities, and our coalition partners about the need to provide equitable access to absentee voting.  This equity issue was raised in legislative testimony, and in our interview with the Legislative Audit Bureau for their review of the 2020 election.  


4) Improve access to voting for care facility residents including recommendations to strengthen the Special Voting Deputy (SVD) program.

Voting in care facilities continued to be an area of concern given the high vulnerability of residents to COVID 19 and restrictions on outsiders entering care facilities.  DRW worked with WEC to provide input on WEC training and reference materials to facility staff, and also partnered on providing virtual trainings that were offered to facility staff.  Training videos were also available on the Disability Vote Coalition web site, along with a toolkit with voting related resources for service providers to assist them in supporting their residents with voting.  Some residential providers called the DRW Voter Hotline for technical assistance.  

In partnership with the Greater Wisconsin Aging Advocacy Resources (GWAAR), we provided policymakers with comprehensive recommendations to address gaps in the Special Voting Deputy program.  


5) Recruit poll workers with disabilities to improve the accessibility of Wisconsin elections.

Our efforts to recruit poll workers with disabilities were on hold for most of the reporting period due to concerns about the pandemic and the additional risk for poll workers.  As the vaccines became more available, we engaged in some limited efforts to recruit poll workers with disabilities, sharing our video on s PADD, PATBI and PAAT Planning Process

STEP 1: DRW Board conducted virtual listening sessions in conjunction with board meetings during 2021. Notes from those listening sessions were reviewed by the PADD coordinator.

STEP 2: The School & Civil Rights and Community & Institutions teams met virtually in August to review team goals and priorities. Since the teams have multiple funding sources, this process included discussion of, and adoption of, goals and priorities for DRW clients with physical disabilities, mental illness and/or traumatic brain injury in addition to people who have intellectual or developmental disabilities. Discussion of AT issues was woven throughout the meetings. This process involved discussion of data received during the year related to priority areas.  Case experience and trends were considered.  Following the team meetings, the PADD Coordinator reviewed the notes from the meetings and identified which particular goals and priorities were aimed in whole or in part at people with IDD. 

STEP 3: The PADD Coordinator, the PAAT Coordinator, and the PATBI  Coordinator reviewed the notes from the listening sessions and team meetings, examined case data derived from DAD, and considered information received during the calendar year from our service on various administrative agency committees and workgroups, including:  Long Term Care Council (Department of Health Services-DHS),  Children’s Long Term Support Advisory Committee (DHS), IRIS Advisory Committee (DHS) Quarterly Meetings with DHS,  PT/OT and SLP providers (DHS),  Children with Disabilities in the Child Welfare System Standards and Training Workgroup (DCF), Act 185 Programming Workgroup and Girls Committee, Children and Youth Committee of the Mental Health Council (DHS), Office of Children’s Mental Health’s Collective Impact Executive Council (DHS, DCF, DPI, DOC), Coalition for Expanding School Based Mental Health, and Children Come First Advisory Committee (DHS).  The Coordinator then drafted an initial group of PADD Goals and Priorities.

STEP 4:  The PATBI and PAAT plans were completed at this time. 

STEP 5: The initial draft of the PADD plan was then circulated to all employees who are supported by PADD funding or who regularly work with PADD eligible clients with the support of other funding (Public Policy Director, FCIOP program staff, Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) coordinator, and the SSI Managed Care Program Manager). Their comments were considered and, where appropriate, incorporated into the “Draft PADD SGP” which would be made available to the public for comment.

STEP 6: On October 5, 2021 we presented our “Draft PADD SGP” to the University Center for Excellence, Developmental Disabilities Consumer Advisory Committee. Consensus was that the Draft SGP was good and the committee supported it as written. Individual advisory committee members were also encouraged to comment on the document.

STEP 7: Our “Draft PADD SGP” was formally released for a 48-day public comment period on October 13, 2021. It was posted to our website on that date. The document included instructions for how people could provide comments and the deadline to ensure that their comments would be considered (November 30, 2021). In addition, we sent the document to the Board for People with Developmental Disabilities, the membership of the Survival Coalition (statewide coalition of disability organizations), the Independent Living Centers,  The ARC Wisconsin, and Save IRIS. This year we received one comment on our proposed plan. 

STEP 8: Presented our Draft PADD SGP to the Board for People with Developmental Disabilities (Wisconsin's CDD) at its November meeting (November 18, 2021). BPDD endorsed the Draft SGP.

STEP 9: Made final changes to Final Draft of our PADD SGP. The major change was to incorporate a new priority into Goal 1 which reflects the collaborative work we will be doing with the BPDD on their Living Well project.


PAVA Planning Process 

DRW coordinates the Wisconsin Disability Vote Coalition (DVC), in partnership with the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities (BPDD). It is a large cross-disability coalition that includes people with disabilities, a diverse cross section of disability organizations, aging organizations, and other voting rights groups including League of Women Voters of Wisconsin and All Voting Is Local.

With these partners at the table, we develop a Coalition plan of work, which is incorporated within the DRW PAVA plan, in addition to DRW specific activities. The coalition meets monthly and has an annual planning meeting. In 2021, the planning meeting was held in June via Zoom with 17 participants.  In addition to DRW and BPDD, organizations participating in the planning included People First Wisconsin, Independence First, Center for Independent Living of Western Wisconsin, Options for Independent Living, Wisconsin Council of the Blind and Visually Impaired, NAMI Wisconsin, League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, All Voting Is Local, the MS Society, Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources, Milwaukee County Commission on Aging, and the member advisory council of My Choice Family Care. 

There was agreement to continue with the three plan goals we established in 2020, and to update and add to the supporting activities.  

As input for our planning process, DRW and the DVC used several surveys:

• Wisconsin Election Protection 2020 Fall Election Report: Report from Non-Partisan Observers of Voting in the November 3, 2020 Presidential Primary and Spring Election
• A December 2020 DVC survey of service providers to learn about barriers experienced by voters with disabilities and get feedback on our trainings and resource materials
• A May 2021 survey of DVC members to get their concerns and priorities to guide our planning.
• Results of Disability Vote coalition surveys conducted regarding voter experiences in August 2018 election, November 2018 election, and April 2020 election.

Calls to the DRW Voter Hotline are an important input for our PAVA plan.  We log and track calls and identify concerns barriers reported by callers to guide priorities for the plan.  Call volume was high in fall of 2020 because of the Presidential election.  It tapered off in 2021 in the absence of national or high profile state elections.  

We considered input received through social media from people with disabilities regarding their voting experience and barriers through social media, including the Disability Vote Coalition and DRW Facebook pages.

DRW participates in the Wisconsin Election Commission Accessibility Advisory Committee which has quarterly meetings. Issues and barriers identified by this Committee were used to develop the PAVA priorities and plan.

DRW also receives input for the PAVA plan from other coalitions and committees regarding voter experiences and barriers, and these are used to inform our PAVA plan. These include the Survival Coalition of Wisconsin Disability Organizations, Milwaukee Mental Health Task Force, Wisconsin Council on Mental Health, Shelter and Transitional Housing Task Force, and Aging & Disability Professionals of Wisconsin (ADPAW). Input is also provided from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services including from staff that oversee state psychiatric hospitals, long term care facilities, and other residential providers.

We collaborate on our voting advocacy with organizations representing diverse communities and their perspectives inform our plan.  These organizations include the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin, Alianza Latina Aplicando Soluciones, Souls to the Polls, Parent University, Wisconsin United Coalition of Mutual Assistance Associations (WUCMAA), and Voces de la Frontera.

DRW P & A staff had the opportunity to provide input to the PAVA plan at the annual planning meeting in August. DRW specific goals were included in the plan, including our role in conducting polling place accessibility audits, providing direct advocacy assistance to voters with disabilities, and staffing the DRW Voter Hotline.  Planned accessibility audits were not able to move forward due to COVID 19 restrictions.",,,,,
WI,2023,"STEP 1: Each of three P&A sub-teams (Civil Rights, Schools, Community & Institutions) met to discuss FY 23 goals and priorities and engage in initial conversations about FY 24 goals & priorities. These meetings occurred on June 22 (schools), July 27 (Community & Institutions) and August 2 (Civil Rights).   

STEP 2: P&A staff met on August 9, 2023 from 9:30 AM – 3 PM to review team goals and priorities. Attendees were provided materials before the meeting including Goals and Priorities from Funding Year 2022 for PADD, PATBI, PAAT, PAVA and other funding sources. P&A staff generally work in subject-matter focused sub-teams (schools, civil rights, community & institutions including investigations), this process included discussion of, and adoption of, goals and priorities for DRW clients with physical disabilities, mental illness, and/or traumatic brain injury in addition to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. Discussion of AT issues was woven throughout the meeting, as was specific focus on serving people with disabilities navigating multiple systems of oppression such as people of color, people who rely on alternate methods of communication or require an interpreter, people living in poverty or who are unstably housed, and survivors of crime. This process also included discussion of data related to priority areas. Case experience and trends were considered. 
 
STEP 3: P&A leadership reviewed the notes from the sub-team meetings, August 9 meeting, examined DAD case data, and considered information received throughout the year during various agency committees and workgroups including: Long Term Care Council (Department of Health Services-DHS), Children’s Long Term Support Advisory Committee (DHS), IRIS Advisory Committee (DHS), Quarterly meetings with DHS, Department of Public Instruction (DPI) and PT/OT & SLP providers (DHS), Children & Youth Committee of the Mental Health Council (DHS), Office of Children’s Mental Health’s Collective Impact Executive Council (DHS, DCF, DPI, DOC), Children Come First Advisory Committee, No Wrong Door Supporting Kids Together Stakeholder Advisory Committee (DHS, DCF, DPI). The coordinator then drafted proposed PADD Goals and Priorities for Funding Year 2023.    
 
STEP 4: P&A Managing attorney drafted Consolidated P&A Goals & Priorities FY 2024 and distributed the draft plan with all members of the P&A team, PAVA team, Managing Attorney of DRW's Victim Advocacy Program, and DRW leadership (Executive Director, Director of Legal Advocacy). P&A Managing Attorney met with each sub-team to discuss proposed consolidated goals and priorities and received suggested edit and comments by email.  
 
STEP 5: Public service announcements ran on Radio Milwaukee inviting listeners to complete a priorities survey on DRW's website. A 12-question survey was posted on DRW's website. 

STEP 6: On November 10, 2023, our proposed “Consolidated P&A Goals & Priorities FY 2024” was released for 48-day public comment. It was posted on our website on that date. The document included instructions for submitting public comments and deadline to ensure comments would be considered. Notification was sent through Facebook, Twitter, and to our email listserv on November 10 with reminders on December 4, 14, and 19. We received twelve survey responses, and 0 public comments by email. 
 
STEP 6: We presented our “Consolidated P&A Goals & Priorities” to the Board of People with Developmental Disabilities (Wisconsin’s CDD) at its November meeting and previewed it to all members of the Waisman (Wisconsin's UCEDD) Constituent Advisory Committee at the CAC's October meeting, then sent the plan by email to the CAC.  
 
STEP 7: Made final changes to the Proposed PADD SGP. The primary changes were to emphasize that our commitment to providing self-advocacy assistance, conducting training and outreach in partnership with peers and others with lived experience, and clarifying our commitment to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities in the criminal justice system.",,,,,
WV,2020,"DRWV assisted 10 individuals, through service requests, regarding voting rights. 4 of these individuals were hospitalized in either a private or state psychiatric hospital, 2 lived in nursing homes, and 2 lived in the community. During each of these service requests, DRWV provided education on voting rights.

In FY 2020, the PAVA Advocate conducted exterior monitoring of 126 polling sites in 5 WV counties. Findings letters, which includes suggestions for ADA compliance, were sent to the County Clerks.  Issues found included:
• Unstable gravel parking facility surface.
• Ramps with incomplete handrail systems
• Doorknobs
• No access aisle connecting designated accessible street parking
• Deteriorated pavement on entrance route
• Debris between parking facility and entrance route
• Lack of ramp to entrance Numerous posts related to voting are shared on our Facebook page, including important dates for voting registration and absentee ballots.

Vote for Access is a series of five short advocacy videos on the barriers that many disabled voters still face when trying to vote. This non-partisan project is produced by Rooted in Rights and Block by Block Creative, in collaboration with a number of Protection and Advocacy agencies across the country, including DRWV. The goal is to “push for better resources, funding, and awareness to improve accessibility and outreach for disabled voters”. Each episode showcases a specific issue that directly impacts voters with disabilities: attitudinal barriers; access to information; access to the polls; access to alternative voting options; and voter suppression. The host introduced considerations that often aren’t included in conversations about voting rights. She is joined by 16 guests from around the country who speak to their experiences as voters, poll workers, and researchers who can help us understand a better way to ensure equality at the polls. DRWV worked with a state psychiatric hospital and interviewed a long-term forensic patient which was included in the 4th video of the services: Alternatives to Polling Places. He discussed his experience voting absentee and why it is important. They can be found at: https://www.facebook.com/pg/drofwv/videos/?ref=page_internal 

DRWV created another video about how to request an electronic absentee ballot for people with physical disabilities in WV and included a demonstration on how to submit an electronic absentee ballot. It can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIPhMFslQY4&feature=youtu.be 

To ensure that nursing home staff and residents were aware of important voting rights information, an Advocate pulled a list of all licensed nursing homes and assisted living facilities to offer information about voting rights including absentee and electronic voting. The Advocate reached 123 of these facilities. DRWV followed up with a mailing that included information about PAVA, flyers with important voting dates, a voting rights poster, absentee voting details, and materials about Democracy Live. A letter and resources about absentee voting to I/DD Waiver service providers through the state.

Because DRWV staff regularly monitor state psychiatric hospitals, an Advocate worked to ensure our voting dates flyers were displayed on the units of at least 1 of the hospitals.

DRWV provided voting rights training to:
• 17 people, most of whom were blind, during the Members at Large Chapter Meeting for the National Federation of the Blind of WV (NFBWV)
• 85 people during the Fair Shake Network’s Annual Legislative Training Day
• 29 people, including at least 11 individuals with disabilities, during a WVATS Advisory Council meeting; this included a demonstration of Democracy Live
• 5 inmates at one state prison to better understand when they are again eligible to register and vote after being discharged
• 17 agency representatives during a Reentry Council meeting in Mercer County, WV
• 39 staff from an agency who serves I/DD Waiver recipients (upon their request)
• 31 attendees of the Mountain State Conference on Disabilities We did not have the opportunity to set up our outreach display and/or present for many events beyond March 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. We did however seek out as many opportunities to provide virtual presentations as possible.

DRWV staff set up an outreach display and/or explained all of our federal programs, including PADD, PATBI, PAAT, and PAVA, during 24 events in FY 2021. During all of these events, we attempt to reach individuals that we have not yet served as well as people from diverse ethnic and minority communities.

DRWV’s Program Director was interviewed by People First of WV for a Facebook Live event. She explained each of our federal programs. The video has had 199 views. DRWV presented employment rights training to staff from the Veterans Administration (VA). The event was held at the Roark Sullivan Lifeway Center’s Community Center. Roark Sullivan runs a shelter that serves homeless individuals including veterans. A general outreach about our programs and services was also provided. This training was requested by the VA after DRWV reached out several times. The purpose was for VA staff to better 
understand the rights of the homeless veterans they serve and what DRWV can offer. After the presentation, several veterans came in and asked questions about their rights.

DRWV provided training about DRWV’s programs including PADD, PAAT, PATBI, and PAVA, the WV Division of Rehabilitation Services (WVDRS), Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA), and work incentives to 27 individuals, some are veterans, who were accessing a winter freeze shelter in Northern WV. Volunteers and staff were also present.

DRWV promotes employment related training and outreach events through our Facebook page as well. Including posts throughout National Disability Employment Awareness Month.

DRWV worked with Rooted in Rights and other Protection and Advocacy Agencies to create a video about Reasonable Accommodations for Employment of People with Disabilities that was shared on our Facebook pages. It can be found at: https://www.facebook.com/drofwv/videos/1910172849128563/",,,,,

Our March 2023 newsletter was written by an individual with a developmental disability in honor of Developmental Disabilities Awareness month. She titled it ""What I Want You to Know About People with Developmental Disabilities"" and can be found at https://www.drofwv.org/march2023newsletter.",,,,,
WY,2020,"PAVA staff worked with a County Clerk in testing voting equipment, assessing accessibility in polling places, and preparing an article for the P&A monthly newsletter on the new voting machines in Wyoming which included a picture of the County Clerk.  In another county, PAVA staff worked with a County Clerk on curbside voting options for people with disabilities and general accessibility considerations.  PAVA designed a flyer on the availability of its Voter Hotline on Primary Election Day and distributed multiple flyers to all 23 County Clerk offices in Wyoming and various providers of services. PAVA staff participated in a virtual open lab in collaboration with the UCEDD in which voting and accessibility were discussed. In addition, a demonstration of voting equipment was provided.  PAVA staff responded to various requests from some other County Clerks in which PAVA informational materials were requested, such as the ""Voting and Homeless"" brochure, ""Voting Etiquette,"" and general ""Voting Information"".",,,,,
WY,2021,PAVA collaborated with election officials regarding voter identification requirements that are being considered by the Wyoming State Legislature and its possible impact on persons with disabilities who may not possess the necessary paperwork or identification requirements.,,,,,
WY,2023,"In this continuing activity, PAVA educated policy makers regarding the interplay between Wyoming's Guardianship Code and voting rights of persons eligible under PAVA.  The Wyoming Election Code bars persons who are ""currently adjudicated mentally incompetent"" from voting.  Under Wyoming's longstanding interpretation of that provision, guardianship orders using the wording ""mentally incompetent person"" operate as a bar to voting, while guardianship orders using the wording ""incompetent person"" do not.  In practice, the phrases are used randomly in readily available online guardianship forms, leading to the unintended result of disenfranchising people who should be allowed to vote.  PAVA has provided educational information to state and county officials regarding the unintended consequence of printed guardianship forms and have participated in a Guardianship Task Force that is involved in recommending changes to Wyoming's Guardianship Code.  Based on the relative proportion of persons who have PAVA eligible disabilities and who have guardianships using the forms with ""mentally incompetent"" language, it is estimated that 273 persons eligible under PAVA could benefit from this advocacy. During the prior fiscal year, PAVA developed a 30 second television spot with the tag line of ""Equality Means Accessibility"" in which two self-advocates are featured voting.  The spot mentions the Help America Vote Act and its requirement for polling places to be physically accessible.  The Americans with Disabilities Act is also mentioned, with a highlight regarding the requirement for states to provide accommodations for people with disabilities.  The spot includes a shot of a person using a wheelchair and an individual using a service animal to access a polling place.  The spot highlights the availability of the P&A voter hotline where people can obtain additional information.  The spot was filmed on location at a county office building in which actual election judges were included in the filming.  The local County Clerk facilitated PAVA's access to the county building and the county election judges.  During this reporting period, a five-week campaign was conducted using the television spot which was run 2,954 times.  The television spot was streamed on Roku, Amazon Fire, Play Station, Sling, along with more traditional forms of television viewing.  The video was produced with closed captioning. In a previous reporting period, PAVA developed a 30 second radio spot that focused on accessibility in the voting process.  During the current reporting period, the radio spot was featured 312 times throughout Wyoming.  PAVA developed the tag line, ""Equality Means Accessibility"" which was the main message of the radio spot. In a previous funding year, a cinema spot was developed featuring PAVA's theme of ""Equality Means Accessibility in Voting"".  During this reporting period, the cinema spot was shown for one month on 72 movie screens in Wyoming.",,,,,
